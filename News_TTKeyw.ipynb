      "        \"text\": \"The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has said that visas and immigration statuses for nine of its international students and researchers were revoked without any prior warning or explanation. The move comes as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration as well as an attempt to temper the activism that they perceive as hostile to conservatives.\\n\\nTill now, the US government has cancelled the visas of nearly 530 students, faculty and researchers across 88 colleges and universities, as per a report by CBS.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nIn a letter to the MIT community, university president Sally Kornbluth on Monday expressed concern over the recent government actions that, she said, threatened not just MIT's operations but also the country's ability to attract top global talent and maintain scientific leadership.\\n\\n\\\"Since April 4, nine members of our community - students, recent graduates and postdocs - have had their visas and immigration status unexpectedly revoked,\\\" Kornbluth wrote, adding that the lack of any official communication or rationale from the government was alarming.\\n\\nWhile the institute was not directly involved in the lawsuit filed by one affected student, it says it remained \\\"extremely concerned\\\" about the broader implications.\\n\\n\\\"These actions are interfering with the normal functioning of MIT,\\\" Kornbluth said. \\\"They diminish our ability both to serve the nation and to attract the world's finest talent.\\\"\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThe visa revocations come alongside a separate federal policy shift that prompted MIT and several other top-tier universities, including Princeton, Caltech and the University of Illinois, to sue the Department of Energy (DOE) in a Boston federal court.\\n\\nThe lawsuit challenges the administration's sudden decision to cap indirect research cost reimbursements at 15 per cent, a move that could result in hundreds of millions in lost funding for academic institutions engaged in high-stakes research.\\n\\nIndirect costs cover vital infrastructure and services that support scientific research but aren't tied to a specific project. These include safety protocols, facility maintenance, data storage and compliance systems. MIT noted that nearly 1,000 members of its community rely on DOE grants, which were now at risk.\\n\\nIn her letter, Kornbluth said the cuts would \\\"devastate scientific research at America\\u2019s universities\\\" and hurt the country's long-term innovation prospects.\\n\\n\\\"To find those rare people (with exceptional talent), we open ourselves to talent from every corner of the US and from around the globe,\\\" she wrote. \\\"The threat of unexpected visa revocations will make it less likely that top talent from around the world will come to the US - and that will damage American competitiveness and scientific leadership for years to come.\\\"\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThe Department of Energy announced the new cap on April 11, saying it would make federal research spending more transparent and efficient. But universities say the change is unfair and disruptive, especially since many had already agreed on much higher reimbursement rates. For example, the University of Michigan could lose over USD 30 million because of this new rule.\\n\\nThis is the second time in recent months that universities have been forced into court over similar actions. Earlier this year, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) imposed a similar funding cap, which was then challenged in court. A federal judge issued a permanent injunction halting those cuts while the case proceeds.\\n\\nThe government is using funds to negotiate with the universities and ensure they comply with the directives. The punishment for defiance is freezing of funding, like with Harvard University.\\n\\nThe Trump administration on Monday froze approximately USD 2.3 billion in federal funding to Harvard University after the Ivy League school refused to comply with a list of White House demands to limit activism on campus and dismantle its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes.\\n\\nThe freeze includes USD 2.2 billion in grants and USD 60 million in federal contracts, according to the department's task force on combating antisemitism, which said Harvard's resistance reflected \\\"the troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation's most prestigious universities\\\".\\n\\n(With inputs from Reuters)\",\n",

      "        \"title\": \"Bat sizes under scanner: Why BCCI introduced in-match checks in IPL 2025\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"Before the 2025 IPL season, had you ever seen umpires checking the size of bats out in the middle? Probably not. In a first, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has instructed on-field umpires to carry out regular bat size checks during matches in this season of the premier T20 league.\\n\\nThe practice of assessing bat sizes isn't new. Previously, players would submit their bats for inspection either before a match or on its eve-usually inside the dressing room. Those checks were conducted away from public view.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nIn a bid to step up vigilance, on-field umpires have now been directed to use the 'home-shaped bat gauge' during the game itself. According to The Indian Express, every batter must pass the gauge test before taking guard.\\n\\nDuring the first two weeks of April, several batters-including Hardik Pandya, Phil Salt, and Shimron Hetmyer -- had their bats checked by the umpires on the field. To the BCCI's satisfaction, none of the bats examined exceeded the dimensions outlined in the IPL's official rule book. The regulations specify that the bat's width must not exceed 4.25 inches, and it must pass freely through the gauge.\\n\\n\\\"The blade of the bat must not exceed the following dimensions: Width: 4.25 in / 10.8 cm, Depth: 2.64 in / 6.7 cm, Edge: 1.56 in / 4.0 cm. Moreover, it must be able to pass through a bat gauge,\\\" the rule states.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nWhat prompted this change? Were there any violations?\\n\\n\\\"We always conducted bat checks in the dressing room before the start of the innings. Players would hand over their bats and the check would be completed there,\\\" a former umpire told news agency PTI.\\n\\n\\\"Now the question is: did any player submit one bat for inspection and use a different one on the field? If that's the case, then this new protocol is certainly justified. Players often carry multiple bats. While the weight may vary, the height, width (face of the bat), depth (middle of the blade), and edge width must remain within the ICC's prescribed limits,\\\" the umpire added.\\n\\nAccording to The Indian Express, there have been a few instances where players were found using oversized bats. Those players were let off with warnings, but the BCCI has now opted for stricter enforcement. In today's power-hitting era of T20 cricket, concerns about the bat increasingly overshadowing the ball are growing louder.\\n\\nIPL chairman Arun Dhumal, speaking to the newspaper, said the new checks aim to uphold the spirit of the game.\\n\\nTo put things in perspective, in the first three weeks of IPL 2024, teams posted 10 scores in excess of 200. That number has nearly doubled in 2025, with 19 such totals already recorded. Last season, SunRisers Hyderabad led the big-hitting charge, breaching the 260-run mark three times. They also posted the highest team total in IPL history: 287 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThis year, SRH continued their explosive form, posting 286 in their opening game against Rajasthan Royals-just one run short of their own record.\\n\\nBOWLERS VOICE CONCERNS\\n\\nA number of bowlers, including R Ashwin, Kagiso Rabada, and Shardul Thakur, have raised concerns about the increasing imbalance between bat and ball in IPL 2025. The Impact Player rule, which allows teams to effectively play with an extra batter or bowler, has further tilted the game in favour of the batters.\\n\\n\\\"You say bowlers are becoming defensive. I want to speak about that,\\\" Ashwin said on his YouTube channel. \\\"I think bowlers will soon need personal psychologists. I genuinely mean it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let's say bowlers are becoming defensive-fine. But in several cases, bowling has genuinely become impossible,\\\" he added.\\n\\nIn a move to support bowlers, the BCCI has lifted the ban on the use of saliva to assist with reverse swing. Saliva had been prohibited by the ICC during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nAdditionally, to counter the dew factor, the BCCI has approved the use of a second ball during the second innings of IPL 2025 matches.\\n\\nPublished By: Akshay Ramesh Published On: Apr 15, 2025\\n\\nTune In\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"India is expected to receive above-normal monsoon rainfall in 2025, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasting seasonal rainfall at 105% of the long-period average. The projection comes with a model error margin of 5%, officials announced on Tuesday.\\n\\nThe southwest monsoon typically begins its advance over Kerala around June 1 and withdraws by mid-September. The projected above-average rainfall could provide a much-needed lift to the agricultural sector, the Ministry of Earth Sciences said.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nAccording to the IMD, this year\\u2019s forecast suggests that most parts of the country are likely to benefit from favourable rainfall conditions, with the exception of a few regions. Rainfall is expected to be below normal in Ladakh, the Northeast, and Tamil Nadu during the four-month monsoon season.\\n\\nThe IMD defines normal rainfall as between 96% and 104% of the 50-year average of 87 cm (about 35 inches). Any amount above this range is considered \\u201cabove normal.\\u201d\\n\\nThe officials said all key climate factors \\u2014 including the El Nino and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) \\u2014 are currently in a neutral phase. These neutral conditions are considered favourable for a healthy monsoon.\\n\\nEl Nino refers to a climate pattern where the surface waters of the central and eastern Pacific Ocean become warmer than usual, often leading to weaker monsoons and less rainfall in India. The Indian Ocean Dipole refers to a weather phenomenon in the Indian Ocean where the difference in sea surface temperatures between the western and eastern parts affects rainfall. A positive IOD usually brings more rain to India, while a negative IOD can reduce it.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nApart from these, another positive indicator this year is the reduced snow cover over Eurasia and the Himalayan region. Historically, lower snow cover in these areas has been associated with stronger monsoon rainfall in India.\\n\\nWith favourable ocean and atmospheric conditions in place, this year\\u2019s monsoon is expected to be above-average and provide much-needed relief to the agricultural sector.\\n\\nPublished By: sharangee Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"Even as Chennai Super Kings fans dream of a comeback from the five-time champions following a rocky start to their IPL 2025 campaign, some worrying visuals have emerged of MS Dhoni limping after his heroics against the Lucknow Super Giants. The CSK captain did not appear to be at his physical best on Monday, April 14, despite delivering an all-round performance that helped end the team's five-match losing streak.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nDhoni showed signs of discomfort even while keeping wickets. After pulling off a magical run-out of Abdul Samad, he was visibly struggling to maintain his balance. Nevertheless, he walked out to bat when Super Kings required more than 10 runs per over in the final five overs of the chase. He went on to smash 26 off just 11 deliveries in a match-winning partnership with Shivam Dube. Dhoni relied heavily on big shots, avoiding quick singles and steering clear of pushing for extra runs between the wickets.\\n\\nLater, he was later seen limping as he descended the stairs of the dressing room for post-match duties. In fact, Dhoni appeared unable to walk freely as he made his way to collect the Player of the Match award - his first such honour in the IPL in seven years.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nIn a more concerning video that has since gone viral on social media, Dhoni was spotted limping again while entering the team hotel in Lucknow on Monday. However, he was not wearing a knee brace or cap when stepping off the team bus.\\n\\nThala Dhoni limping , Hopefully not a serious one pic.twitter.com/cYfPOpWARG\\u2014 Chakri Dhoni (@ChakriDhonii) April 15, 2025\\n\\nWhile it is no secret that Dhoni has been managing a troublesome knee over the past few years, Monday marked the first time this season that he was seen in visible discomfort.\\n\\nHowever, neither MS Dhoni nor the Chennai Super Kings management have expressed any concerns over a potential injury. CSK\\u2019s bowling coach, Eric Simons, did not address the matter when speaking to the press following the team\\u2019s victory in Lucknow.\\n\\nDhoni remained calm and composed on the field after winning the toss and choosing to field against a power-packed Lucknow Super Giants batting line-up. He was sharp behind the stumps and executed a sensational run-out with a direct hit from well behind the wicket, catching the batter short at the non-striker's end. He was also tested by Matheesha Pathirana, who sent down several deliveries straying down the leg side, keeping Dhoni on his toes.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThanks to Dhoni's excellent glovework and a disciplined bowling performance, Super Kings restricted the Super Giants to 166 runs in their allotted 20 overs.\\n\\nDhoni has been managing a wobbly knee throughout his recent IPL stints. During the 2023 season, he led CSK to their fifth IPL title while playing through pain, before undergoing surgery in Mumbai after the tournament.\\n\\nHowever, knee concerns resurfaced in 2024. Despite the recurring issues, Dhoni managed to play all 14 matches for CSK last season.\\n\\nIn a recent podcast, Dhoni said that his future in the IPL would depend on how his body responds at the end of each season.\\n\\nCSK fans will be hoping the veteran wicketkeeper recovers in time and regains full fitness ahead of their high-stakes clash against the Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede Stadium on Sunday, 20 April. The Super Kings have a five-day break before that marquee fixture.\\n\\nPublished By: Akshay Ramesh Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"title\": \"Why Mehul Choksi's extradition could be a challenge for India\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"There is renewed hope in India that fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi will be extradited following his arrest in the Belgian city of Antwerp on April 12 on the request of Indian authorities.\\n\\nChoksi, 65, is a key accused in the Rs 13,500 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam, along with nephew Nirav Modi, 54. The case against Modi is that he connived with PNB officials since 2011 to fraudulently raise letters of understanding (LoUs) without the mandatory collaterals and obtained foreign loans, ostensibly for importing pearls and diamonds to make jewellery. However, the money thus raised was used only to retire old debt, ultimately leading to an \\u2018ever-greening\\u2019 of loans.\\n\\n\\n\\nEver since the unravelling of the Nirav Modi scam, Choksi too came under the radar of investigating agencies, including the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Choksi is alleged to owe over Rs 6,000 crore to 34 Indian banks after raising loans in a manner similar to Modi. After the scam came to light in January 2018, Choksi fled to the Caribbean nation of Antigua and Barbuda, where he had taken citizenship.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn May 2021, Choksi surfaced in neighbouring Dominica, where he was detained for illegal entry. A team of CBI officials were flown to Dominica to bring Choksi back, but the move failed as Choksi was allowed by the Dominica High Court in July 2021 to travel back to Antigua to seek medical help.\\n\\n\\n\\nFollowing this, all proceedings against Choksi in Dominica were dropped. Media reports say Choksi had come to Belgium last year for treatment of cancer and had been in that country since.\\n\\n\\n\\nChoksi, who owned Gitanjali Gems, was one of the country\\u2019s most high profile jewellers. At its peak, Gitanjali Gems had 4,000 retail outlets and enjoyed a market share of over 50 per cent of the country\\u2019s organised jewellery market, with prominent brands, including Nakshatra and Gili.\\n\\n\\n\\nIndia and Belgium had a treaty on mutual extradition of fugitive criminals dating back to October 1901, when the former was under British rule. This has gone through several amendments. The two countries signed the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty in 2020 for better cooperation on fugitives.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat India was able to get Choksi arrested in Belgium is a diplomatic win for the government, but it is not clear when he can be extradited to India. This is because the process of extradition is often time consuming, especially since the country of extradition happens to be in Europe.\\n\\n\\n\\nMoreover, the experience with other high-profile fugitives, such as Modi and Vijay Mallya (he left India in 2016), has not been too rosy. Despite several attempts by India, both Mallya and Modi, who are currently based in the UK, have continued to remain out of the dragnet.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat could be a dampener in Choksi\\u2019s extradition from Belgium is the \\u201cdual-criminality\\u201d clause in the extradition treaty. This means a person can be extradited only if his or her offence, including financial bungling, is punishable in both jurisdictions involved, in this case both India and Belgium. That would mean Belgium should consider all charges against Choksi as alleged by India to be punishable under that country\\u2019s law.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere would be a lengthy judicial process involved before the extradition can happen. Moreover, there could be concerns related to human rights since Choksi was arrested in Belgium, where the European Convention on Human Rights applies, say media reports.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ED had been trying to liquidate Choksi\\u2019s assets so that they can pay off the victims of the bank fraud, but the process has been slow. In February 2021, the ED attached assets worth Rs 14.45 crore belonging to the Gitanjali Group and Choksi in relation to the PNB scam.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe attached assets included a 1,460 square feet flat in Mumbai\\u2019s Goregaon, and gold and platinum jewellery, diamond, precious stones, pearl-silver necklaces, watches and a Mercedes Benz car registered in the name of Gitanjali Group and Choksi, the ED said. Earlier, the ED had attached properties worth more than Rs 2,550 crore in the matter.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nSubscribe to India Today Magazine\\n\\nPublished By: Mansi Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"OnePlus has officially confirmed the launch of its next smartphone, the OnePlus 13T, in China on April 24. The company has already begun teasing the phone's design and features, offering a clear early look at what the device will bring to the table. Some of the specifications of the upcoming OnePlus phone have also leaked online. If you haven't been keeping tabs on the OnePlus 13T developments, here are 7 key things we already know about it ahead of the official launch.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nOnePlus 13T launch date announced: 7 things we already know about it\\n\\n-The OnePlus 13T will be available in three colours \\u2014 Morning Mist Gray, Cloud Ink Black, and a special Pink edition. All three shades will feature a low-saturation matte finish, which OnePlus says aligns with its new design approach focused on subtlety and elegance.\\n\\n-OnePlus is seemingly ditching curves in favour of a more squared-off look. The 13T is confirmed to feature a 6.32-inch display with flat sides and rounded corners. This suggests that the 13T will have a compact form factor in comparison to the original OnePlus 13 smartphone.\\n\\n-The phone features what OnePlus calls a \\\"metal cube Deco\\\" \\u2014 a one-piece metallic camera module that gives the back a more unified and refined feel. It marks a departure from previous designs and is intended to match the phone\\u2019s minimal aesthetics, something which the company suggested through its teasers.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n-The iconic Alert Slider is being replaced with a new button that can still toggle between silent, vibration, and ring modes. However, this button can also be customised for different tasks, which is likely to offer more flexibility than its predecessor.\\n\\n-The 13T will come with a dual rear camera setup. While OnePlus hasn\\u2019t detailed the sensors, leaks suggest a 50-megapixel main sensor paired with a 50-megapixel 2x telephoto lens. This combination hints at a focus on balanced performance rather than simply increasing sensor count.\\n\\n-One of the highlights of the 13T is its large battery, confirmed to be more than 6,000mAh. Alongside that, the phone is said to support 80W fast charging tech, which may make it suitable for power users who need reliability without frequent top-ups.\\n\\n-Under the hood, the phone is tipped to run on Qualcomm\\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Elite chipset, which also powered the OnePlus 13 smartphone. This would make it one of the most powerful (and affordable) OnePlus phones yet, paired with a 1.5K 120Hz OLED display that complements its performance with visuals to match.\\n\\nThe OnePlus 13T will be launched in China first, but global rollout details could follow soon after. It is important to note that a few details are based on the leaks and that the company is yet to confirm all the features of the device. But, you can stay tuned to India Today Tech for all the updates.\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"(NOTE: This article was originally published in the India Today issue dated February 15, 1982)\\n\\n\\\"They are cremating Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru for the second time (at National Herald)\\\". Thus wrote septuagenarian M.C. Chalapati Rau, doyen of the \\u2018nationalist press\\u2019 and editor of the Herald for nearly four decades, in a letter addressed to Mrs Gandhi back in 1978.\\n\\nFour years after Rau left that huffy note and resigned, the cremation seemed to be still smouldering. Tottering on the verge of bankruptcy and unable to stem the tide of mismanagement and executive corruption, the Congress(I) high command - which holds controlling shares through a trust - was toying with two alternatives last fortnight: to close down most of its publications, or to sack the present board of directors of the company that publishes the Herald chain, Associated Journals Limited (turnover in 1980-81: Rs 2.5 crore).\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThe Chairman and Managing Director of Associated Journals, Yashpal Kapoor, Mrs Gandhi\\u2019s potbellied Man Friday, recently got a reprieve when the skeletal three-man directors\\u2019 board survived an annual general meeting with most shareholders submissively sending their proxy to Kapoor.\\n\\nBut the company\\u2019s balance sheet, which was surprisingly not circulated at the seemingly well-rehearsed annual general meeting, shows a whopping accumulated loss of Rs 70 lakh against an issued capital base of just Rs 56 lakh. The paper has started skipping editions because newsprint cannot be paid for; payment of wages has become irregular; the journalists, with fingers crossed, are waiting to jump out.\\n\\nTo cap it all, the charmed circle around Rajiv Gandhi has begun a discreet enquiry into the affairs of Associated Journals. Unconfirmed reports hint at Kapoor\\u2019s eventual succession by Arun Nehru, the MP from Uttar Pradesh.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nLiquidity: Talking to INDIA TODAY, Nehru side-stepped the issue of his possible charge by describing it as \\\"pre mature\\\". But he admitted having discussed the \\\"sickness\\u2019 of National Herald and its sister publications with his friend, Rajiv. Many Herald insiders would welcome Nehru for his \\\"high connection\\\" and the board-room experience he earned as managing director of a multinational paints company.\\n\\nHowever, a mere change of guard may not pull the company back from the financial precipice where it has landed itself. In a bid to expand senselessly and far beyond its means, the company has run into what Kapoor himself recognises as the \\\"gravest liquidity problem\\\" in its 44-year history. Samples:\\n\\nThe 496 employees at the New Delhi office were paid their salary for December two weeks after the due date. The chief editor, Hari Jaisingh, got his cheque on January 13.\\n\\nThe nearly 400 employees at the Lucknow office got their salary for October, and that too in instalments, in December.\\n\\nThe Press Trust of India withdrew its tickers from the Herald offices last fortnight after arrears crossed Rs 3 lakh.\\n\\nThe Municipal Corporation of Delhi served final notice on the company last fortnight that the water connection at its offices would be cut because of non-payment of Rs 80,000 of arrear bills.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThe Lucknow edition dropped a day\\u2019s issue in December because it had no cash to buy newsprint. It also can\\u2019t make blocks because the management says it is unable to buy an AC/DC converter worth Rs 3,000.\\n\\nA former employee, sacked six years ago, recently got a High Court decree issued against the company for payment of Rs 17,800 to him as compensation. Since the company said its coffers were empty even office equipment - such as cyclostyling machines - had to be seized and sold last fortnight to pay the ex-employee.\\n\\nA cheque for Rs 50, given to a contributor, bounced recently.\\n\\nThe Herald\\u2019s saga of hard luck does not end here. In 1976, its banker, Punjab National Bank, was compelled by the Emergency regime to sanction a fat loan to the company for the purchase of a Soviet-made rotary machine.\\n\\nThe loan was never paid back, and the bank went to court to obtain a decree of Rs 12 lakh against the company. It was a tricky situation for the guarantor, Vijaya Bank, which paid the money to Punjab National Bank but has little hope of getting back the instalments and interest. Another litigation is inevitable.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nNotorious reputation: The company is notoriously cynical about borrowing and not paying back. A loan of Rs 30 lakh raised by it in 1975-76 for construction of a new building in Lucknow has now become Rs 80 lakh with interest. \\\"We haven\\u2019t been able to pay back a copper of that,\\\" said Kapoor with what looked like an oddly satisfied smile.\\n\\nBehind this shoddy financial profile of the company, and the apparent ineptitude of its managers, lurks a systematic plan to keep it perpetually under the thumb of Mrs Gandhi and her chosen people. The key to it is held by Jan Hit Nidhi Trust, formed by Jawaharlal Nehru\\u2019s associates - P.N. Sapru, Umashankar Dixit and Padmaja Naidu - in the late \\u201850s, which holds Rs 40 lakh of the Associated Journals\\u2019 Rs 56 lakh of issued capital.\\n\\nIts three present trustees are: P.A. Narielwala, former Tata employee, Congressman, and secretary to the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund; Umashankar Dixit, a former Union home minister and Congress(I) veteran; and, Bishambhar Nath Pandey, president of the Uttar Pradesh Congress(I) Committee. Apparently, all three of them repose their trust firmly in Mrs Gandhi.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nIn 1978, when Mrs Gandhi broke away to form her own party, the trustees took shelter behind a clause in the company\\u2019s 1938 article of association which said \\\"the policies of the newspapers published by the company will be to support and propagate the policies of the Indian National Congress\\\". The trustees - predictably - resolved that Mrs Gandhi\\u2019s party alone was the true Congress.\\n\\nIndividual shareholders: Besides the Trust, the company\\u2019s shares are held by about 300 individuals, only five of whom own shares worth more than Rs 1 lakh. Mrs Gandhi herself owns just Rs 1,000-worth of shares, for which she sent her proxy to Kapoor at the last annual general meeting.\\n\\nThe paper, which had a glorious record during the freedom movement, came up in the wake of the first popular ministry in Uttar Pradesh in 1937. Nehru and Rafi Ahmed Kidwai took the initiative, and funds poured in from all corners of the country. But subsequent leaders of the Herald deftly kept the original donors out of the picture.\\n\\nThe Tatas, for example, donated a sum of Rs 3 lakh which was in preference shares and was never converted into equities, thus denying the family reputed for its professional ability any say at the shareholders\\u2019 meetings.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nKapoor was chosen by Mrs Gandhi in 1978 when the previous managing director, Mohammed Yunus, resigned after submitting a strongly-worded report favouring closure of the Delhi edition of the paper. Yunus\\u2019 decision was born out of pragmatism: the Delhi edition sold just about 1,000 copies at that time compared with 5,000 for the Lucknow edition.\\n\\nBut Mrs Gandhi, pitted against generally hostile media, needed the Herald to continue in the capital, and Kapoor obliged her by continuing to roll out the Delhi edition, throwing overboard all financial considerations.\\n\\nUntraceable accounts: During the Emergency the company raked in enormous funds through questionable advertisement collections and doubtful and often unaccounted donations. An enquiry by the Company Law Board, the report of which was hushed up soon after the Congress(I)\\u2019s return to power, established that sources of an amount of Rs 4.87 crore, shown in the book of accounts, were \\\"untraceable\\\".\\n\\nHowever, after Mrs Gandhi\\u2019s defeat in 1977, sources of finance ran dry. Kapoor had to fall back on the age-old escape route from financial distress: robbing employees.\\n\\nHis management stopped transmitting employees\\u2019 insurance premiums; provident fund and health insurance dues were deducted from employees\\u2019 salary but not paid to the relevant departments; income tax deducted at source was not deposited; auditors checking the company\\u2019s balance sheets were aghast to find that there was no system of internal auditing.\\n\\nThis was topped with a paralysing lock-out in all offices of the Herald from March 1979 till the next year. The paper limped back to normalcy only after Mrs Gandhi came back to power in 1980.\\n\\nMeanwhile, journalists and other staff left the paper in droves, some in disgust, others out of sheer necessity. Even Khushwant Singh, who had a brief stint as the chief editor, faltered in his determination to improve Mrs Gandhi\\u2019s image when he was unable to make the management pay the staff their salary every month.\\n\\nPromises: Kapoor brought in Hari Jaisingh, a nondescript resident editor of the Ahmedabad edition of Indian Express, as the chief editor. With the happy tiding of 1980 came promises of more donations, more advertisements, more forced sales.\\n\\nKapoor reconstituted the board of directors, its two other members being Vimal Malhotra, a small-time industrialist who, as a trade union leader, had once headed the National Herald employees\\u2019 union, and Mallikarjun, deputy minister for Railways, who held the post in total violation of the convention that no minister should hold a director\\u2019s office.\\n\\nIn the name of expansion, the board opened up a chapter of unprecedented squander-mania. Three editions of the Herald\\u2019s sister Urdu publication, Quaumi Awaz, were started from Delhi, Bombay and Patna, apart from its usual Lucknow edition.\\n\\nA parallel unit was begun from New Delhi\\u2019s Indian and Eastern Newspapers Society (IENS) building to bring out English and Hindi editions of a little-known publication called Indian Farmers\\u2019 Journal. The other plans on the card include three new editions of Herald, and its Hindi co-publication, Navjivan (now brought out from Lucknow alone), from Bombay, Hyderabad and Bhopal.\\n\\nIn the process, however, the company\\u2019s real interest was diverted from newspapering to construction. Next to its present office at Kaiserbagh on the banks of the Gomti in Lucknow, it began a 12-storeyed building for Rs 4 crore; at Bhopal, it concluded a controversial land deal with the Bhopal Development Authority to start construction of yet another building for Rs 2 crore.\\n\\nVarious queries: From where did the promise of new capital come? And - as many in Herald are asking now - if money was at all available, why wasn\\u2019t it used to clear the debts to banks, the Government and the employees? However, Kapoor is not amused.\\n\\nRecently, he stopped deduction of provident fund for all employees drawing over Rs 1,600 a month on the plea that the Provident Fund Act allows him to do so - a contention not corroborated so far by the Fund authorities. Thus, he has escaped statutory obligations in every way on the plea of economy, but has still managed to go ahead with his grandiose \\u2018expansion plans\\u2019.\\n\\nLast fortnight, Kapoor, talking to INDIA TODAY, admitted that the buildings were to be financed by a \\\"group of businessmen\\\" who would \\\"not charge Herald a rupee\\\". But he was silent on:\\n\\n-Whether this transaction would be shown in the company\\u2019s books of account and, if so, how;\\n\\n-Why the concerned businessmen offered to make contributions; and,\\n\\n-How business in real estate was consistent with National Herald\\u2019s memorandum of association.\\n\\nBrushing these issues aside, Kapoor said: \\\"The main task is to make Associated Journals Limited immune to the Congress Party\\u2019s vicissitudes of fortune. We were victims of a systematic witch-hunt during the Janata period, when our advertisement earnings were forcibly lowered, our workers were instigated to go on strike, and the paper was dragged into a tangle of false litigations. The buildings will allow us relative independence even when the Congress is out of power. We want to be free from financial worries for all time to come.\\\"\\n\\nBoth Kapoor and Jaisingh claim to have gone a long way in \\u2018professionalising\\u2019 the organisation. \\\"We\\u2019ve been objective in our reporting and fair in our editorial views, within certain parameters, of course.\\\" defensively argues a mild-mannered Jaisingh. \\\"We even print Opposition news.\\\" piped in Kapoor more bluntly.\\n\\nHowever, as a senior journalist in the paper remarked, \\\"Herald projects only two leaders, if you may say so: Mrs Gandhi and Yashpal Kapoor.\\\" In 1981, Kapoor\\u2019s statements and photographs were front-paged over 50 times in the paper, variously describing him as \\\"senior Congress leader\\\", \\\"prominent leader of the Indian National Trade Union Congress\\\", and \\\"leading social worker\\\".\\n\\nQuipped the journalist, \\\"For the readers of the Herald - not a large community, I dare say - the race between the prime minister and Kapoor is quite a photo finish, with Rajiv Gandhi coming in as a distant third.\\\"\\n\\nToeing the line: On reporting political issues, the paper often toes the Congress(I) line in quite a brazen-faced manner. On the eve of the Opposition-sponsored Bharat Bandh on January 19, its two main front-page headlines read: \\\"Government to be tough on coercing strikers\\\" and \\\"More to ignore bandh\\\".\\n\\nWhen the Maharashtra chief minister, A.R. Antulay lost his case at Bombay High Court and resigned, the editorial in National Herald merely sang paeans of praise to Mrs Gandhi for being \\\"democratic\\\" in accepting Antulay\\u2019s resignation.\\n\\nHowever, its closeness to the Congress(I) gives it occasional flashes of insight: it was the only daily to predict the latest round of reshuffles in the Union Cabinet on the morning it took place.\\n\\nIt is true that there have been confusing trends once in a while; like the Herald suddenly publishing an article by T.N. Kaul criticising the recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan. But insiders promptly put it down to \\\"editorial ignorance\\\" of which way the wind was blowing.\\n\\nA front-page article criticising the Congress(I) chief ministers\\u2019 frequent trips to Delhi was explained by them as a subtle attempt to \\\"wangle\\\" state government advertisements.\\n\\nHowever, to ask the Herald authorities about its circulation - like asking a woman her age - is considered impolite. Though Jaisingh claims a weekday circulation of 20,000-plus in the capital and 30,000-plus in Lucknow, a representative of the National Herald Employees\\u2019 Union averred that the combined daily sale was \\\"within 15,000\\\".\\n\\nOn such a slender circulation base, how the paper brings out 10 to 12 supplements - loaded with ads - in a month is a mystery in the newspaper circle. In 1980-81, it netted Rs 1.25 crore from advertisements. As Kapoor fondly mused, \\\"Our ad and circulation boys are simply brilliant.\\\"\\n\\nThat again is a mystery. Last year, both the circulation and advertisement managers of the company quit their posts. The new circulation manager, who was catapulted to the office, was once a timekeeper in the Lucknow office, while the new advertisement manager was a clerk in the advertisement department.\\n\\nIn fact, examples of such spectacular rises are legion at National Herald: a sub-editor overnight finds himself in the chair of a leader writer, a junior sports sub is suddenly anointed as the sports editor, a line operator takes over as the chief press supervisor.\\n\\nChalapati Rau, who had once in disgust burnt copies of the paper at the site of Nehru\\u2019s cremation at Shantivana, remarked: \\\"The National Herald\\u2019s only editorial policy is to sing bhajans to Indira Gandhi and Yashpal Kapoor; its only business policy is to plunder resources and to secure ads by blackmail.\\\"\\n\\nFirmness: Rau has a right to vituperate. During the Emergency, when he was the chief editor, he did not allow any statement or photograph of Sanjay Gandhi, then all-powerful in the Congress, to appear in the paper. He refused to draw a salary of more than Rs 2,000 a month (Jaisingh gets Rs 8,000, including perks).\\n\\nEven Mrs Gandhi used to fear the sharpness of his tongue and the acid in his pen. In 1978, he was thrown out of office, and, since then, Kapoor has taken care to see that his Rs 1,500 monthly pension is stopped.\\n\\nEven a member of the Jan Hit Nidhi Trust, who refused to be identified, agrees that the paper has little viability unless \\\"we choose between two alternatives: to run it as a purely professional organisation, or to run it as a completely above-board party organ, free from wheeler-dealers\\u2019 interference\\\".\\n\\nHe cited the example of Hindustan Times, which started as a mouthpiece of the Gadr Party but later on became a commercial organisation under the Birlas, and survived. At the other end of the gamut, the two communist parties, he said, have been able to continue with their respective party organs without undue reliance on advertising revenue.\\n\\nBut the Herald, with its 900 staff, and its management\\u2019s all-consuming desire to turn it into a money-spinner, cannot but choose a half-way house from where it has to increasingly lean on non-newspaper profits: in 1980-81, it earned Rs 20 lakh by renting out its premises in Delhi.\\n\\n\\\"No newspaper\\\", said the sceptic trustee, \\\"has ever been profitable by propagating the views of one political party.\\\" Evidently not impressed by this line of argument, Kapoor counterposed, \\\"If the Congress can be a viable party, why can\\u2019t National Herald be a viable paper?\\\" No wonder that the current joke at the Herald office is to whisper aloud: \\\"We want Antulay\\\".\\n\\nSubscribe to India Today Magazine\\n\\nPublished By: Mansi Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"The second season of The Last of Us introduces new characters and a mysterious figure named Eugene, whose death stirs curiosity. Though never seen alive in the series, Eugene\\u2019s story, tied to Joel\\u2019s actions, leaves fans eager for answers. Here\\u2019s everything known about him from the HBO series and the games it\\u2019s based on.\\n\\n\\n\\n[SPOILERS AHEAD]\\n\\n\\n\\nHow is Eugene portrayed in The Last of Us game?\\n\\n\\n\\nIn The Last of Us Season two, Eugene is a background presence, never met but often mentioned by Ellie and Dina. They describe him as a funny, sharp man skilled with electronics, teaching Dina her technical know-how. A weed enthusiast, he left a lasting impression, but his life was troubled.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a Firefly resistance member, he was often away from his wife and child. Players find a note from his wife in an abandoned library outpost, pleading for his return. Dina shares darker tales, saying Eugene and Tommy committed terrorist acts, including an attack on FEDRA forces in Denver that killed three soldiers and two civilians. She also recalls the \\u201cslow-torturing\\u201d a FEDRA general, noting, \\u201cThey got into some real dark s**t.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\nEllie and Dina say Eugene died at 73 from a stroke, likely without reuniting with his family.\\n\\n\\n\\nWho was Eugene?\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the HBO series, Eugene is introduced through Gail, Joel\\u2019s therapist, played by Catherine O\\u2019Hara. Like in the games, he grew marijuana, with Gail saying, \\u201cthe man would grow buds the size of pinecones \\u2014 sticky as glue.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\nUnlike the games, Gail was his wife, and Joel killed him. She confronts Joel, stating, \\u201cYou shot and killed my husband. You killed Eugene, and I resent you for it. No, maybe a little more than that. I hate you for it. And yes, I know you had no choice. I know that. I know I should forgive you. But I tried, and I can\\u2019t. Because of how you did it.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\nGail marks her \\u201cfirst birthday without my husband in 41 years,\\u201d suggesting a recent death. Her comment that Joel had \\u201cno choice\\u201d hints Eugene was infected, but her anger suggests complexity. As per the Entertainment Weekly report, a flashback episode featuring Joe Pantoliano as Eugene will reveal more.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy did Joel kill Eugene?\\n\\n\\n\\nThe reason remains unclear. Gail\\u2019s belief that Joel had \\u201cno choice\\u201d points to Eugene being infected, but her deep resentment implies there\\u2019s more to the story.\\n\\n\\n\\nO\\u2019Hara told Entertainment Weekly, \\u201cI\\u2019ve never had to cry so much for so many takes,\\u201d about filming the flashback, calling it \\u201ckiller.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\nCo-creator Neil Druckmann told Variety, \\u201cThe story we told [in the game] was somewhat superficial. The way this character comes in really gets to the heart of Joel and Ellie and their relationship.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere and When to Watch The Last of Us?\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Last of Us Season two is currently streaming on Max, with season 2 episodes airing Sundays at 9 pm ET/PT and 8 pm CT. According to the Entertainment Weekly report, Eugene\\u2019s story adds depth to the series. His death, distinct from the game\\u2019s stroke to Joel\\u2019s actions in the show, sets up a pivotal moment that will explore Joel and Ellie\\u2019s bond, keeping viewers hooked.\\n\\nPublished By: Aashish Vashistha Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"There's something about one-shot scenes that brings an inherent excitement, and a sense of unparalleled immersiveness to cinema. A section of the audience couldn't have been more aware of this camera technique until Netflix's 'Adolescence' broke the barriers of storytelling. It was raw, well-coordinated, demanding and so precise that it provided an extra edge to the story. But, this is not the first time that the Indian audience and filmmakers have woken up to this kind of camera movement technique.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nSeveral OTT shows and films have done the same over the years in various scenes to give the audience a taste of something different, something that sets them apart. Have a look at a few here:\\n\\n1. Ship of Theseus (2012): The mother is admitted scene (7 minutes)\\n\\nSohum Shah\\u2019s 'Ship of Theseus' wasn\\u2019t just a philosophical piece, it was also technically brilliant. One of its most powerful scenes, where a mother is admitted to the hospital, plays out in a 7-minute continuous take. The shot captures the chaotic yet intimate emotions of a man navigating bureaucracy, morality, and grief \\u2014 all in one breathless sequence that never cuts away.\\n\\n2. Viduthalai (2023): The train scene (8 minutes)\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nVetri Maaran\\u2019s 'Vidhuthalai' delivers an edge-of-the-seat 8-minute sequence involving a train and a tense, escalating situation. Shot in a single take, the scene is a technical surprise, immersing the audience right into the unfolding drama with no moment to pause or look away. The fluid camera work and the unflinching performances make it one of the most gripping one-take sequences in Indian cinema.\\n\\n3. The Family Man (2019): Hospital assault sequence (13 minutes)\\n\\nShot in a real, functioning hospital with actual heart patients in the ward, this 13-minute one-take sequence is one of 'The Family Man's' most intense moments. Filmed from the villains' perspective, it builds a wave of dread as danger creeps toward unsuspecting characters.\\n\\nInterestingly, despite having just two nights at the expensive location \\u2014 one for rehearsal, and another for shooting - co-director DK refused to break the shot. And the team pulled it off in a single go. It can definitely be seen as a masterclass in coordination, tension, and bold storytelling.\\n\\n4. Gangs of Wasseypur (2012): Home shootout (7 minutes)\\n\\nAnurag Kashyap\\u2019s 'Gangs of Wasseypur' is known for its gritty realism, and one of its standout moments is a seven-minute one-take sequence capturing a frantic shootout. The camera doesn't flinch and follows Faizal Khan's (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) character running through narrow alleys, ducking bullets, and raging through the violence. It's tense, raw, with a slight punch of humour making it deeply cinematic \\u2014 a moment that stays with you long after the film ends.\\n\\n5. Dil Dhadakne Do (2015): The Gallan Goodiyan song (4 minutes)\\n\\nNot all one-take scenes are about action or intensity. Sometimes, it\\u2019s about capturing joy. The 'Gallan Goodiyan' song from 'Dil Dhadakne Do' is a vibrant 4-minute single-shot celebration, following the characters around a cruise ship dinner party as they sing and dance. It\\u2019s also something which can be seen as choreography-triumph, with a spontaneous and infectious sense of pure joy.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n6. CID - The Inheritance (111 minutes)\\n\\nOn November 7, 2004, Sony TV ran a special episode of CID, titled 'The Inheritance', without any single cut. BP Singh, the director of the show, wanted to make an entry into the Guinness Book of World Records and Limca Book of Records, and therefore, he decided to shoot a 111-minute-long episode of the popular show using the one-shot technique, which later went into the pages of history. It didn't just create a record for the longest shot episode, but also for the longest shot to be filmed ever.\\n\\nThe one-shot sequences are demanding. They demand perfection, a solid hold on one's craft, and the best kind of coordination between artistes, cinematographers, directors and the audience. At the end of it all lies audacity, and a spirit to experiment. Indian cinema and the OTT space got to stay on the hustle.\\n\\nPublished By: Vineeta Kumar Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

The statement read, \\\"We have noted with concern a social media post by Mr Das about a wheelchair not being provided to his co-passenger while travelling from Mumbai to Delhi on AI816 on 14 April 2025. We empathise with the guests, especially given the mobility concern involved, and recognize that this experience fell short of expectations. The operating cabin crew offered to assist the guest, including deplaning by using the 'ambulift' assigned to the aircraft as per SOP, but the delay\\u2014not denial\\u2014in providing wheelchair assistance was due to unusually high demand for wheelchairs and staff at that time.

The electric SUV will have a quad-wheel-drive (QWD) dual motor setup, delivering 500Nm of peak torque. \\\"We are targeting a real-world range of around 500km, addressing range anxiety,\\\" Srivatsa said.\\n\\nThe real-world range for EVs is usually lower than the range certified by Modified Indian Drive Cycle. Among the Tata EVs, the Curvv.ev has the highest real-world range of up to 425km on a single full charge, followed by the Nexon.ev of up to 375km.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nAccording to data from the industry body Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA), Tata's electric car sales fell 10.71% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 57,616 units in FY25 from 64,530 units in FY24. Moreover, the segment share dropped to 53.52% in FY25 from 70.52% in FY24.\\n\\nThe arrival of rival original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) like Mahindra and JSW MG Motor India with new models in the electric car space is among the reasons for Tata's share taking a hit.\\n\\nWhen asked about the decline in Tata's share, Srivatsa said: \\\"With more players, the share will certainly even itself out, but we know we will continue to lead the category, leveraging our deep understanding of the Indian consumer and their nuances.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Temporary challenges do not deter us, as the largest four-wheeler manufacturer in this space, we offer the widest range of EVs, priced between Rs 8 lakh and Rs 22 lakh across a variety of body styles and battery pack options. This is a portfolio tailor-made to the Indian customers' preference and use case, unlike other products in the market, which are derivatives of offerings tailored to global markets, with very little Indian context,\\\" he observed.\\n\\nHaving started with the Nexon.ev in 2020, Tata has sold over 2,00,000 units of electric cars till now. The company manufactures EVs across its Pune, Ranjangaon and Sanand facilities.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nEarlier this year, Tata introduced the Open Collaboration 2.0 framework to enhance India's EV charging ecosystem. It aims to more than double the number of charging points to 4,00,000 by 2027 in partnership with charge point operators (CPOs) and oil marketing companies (OMCs).\\n\\n\\\"India's charging infrastructure is more of a chicken and egg story, with increasing EV adoption, charging points too will increase. Private CPOs are imperative in setting up a charging infrastructure that works for the benefit of the customer.

      "        \"text\": \"Just days after the NEET UG controversy, the National Testing Agency (NTA) is once again facing sharp criticism -- this time over factual mistakes and technical issues in the JEE Main 2025 Session 2 exam.\\n\\nStudents, parents, and educators are up in arms after the release of the provisional answer key and response sheets on April 11.\\n\\nCOACHING HUB KOTA FLAGS MULTIPLE ERRORS\\n\\nThe latest storm was kicked off by students from Kota, Rajasthan -- India\\u2019s biggest coaching hub for engineering aspirants, as per a Times of India report. These students spotted at least nine questionable answers in the JEE Main 2025 April 9 paper.\\n\\nThe errors span all three core subjects: four in physics, three in chemistry, and two in maths. Students say the problems aren\\u2019t just tricky questions -- they are factually incorrect and could seriously affect scores.\\n\\nTop coaching centres and subject experts backed the students\\u2019 claims, saying the problems show poor quality control by NTA for such a major national exam.\\n\\nEducator and commentator @kamath_pramod posted on X, \\u201cIt\\u2019s unacceptable that such basic mistakes are creeping into national-level exams.\\u201d He highlighted one modern physics question from the April 7 AM shift, calling it \\u201cconceptually flawed.\\u201d\\n\\nHe added, \\u201cIf NTA doesn\\u2019t correct this, it\\u2019s an injustice to lakhs of students.\\u201d\\n\\nAnother user on X put it bluntly: \\u201cTragedy of errors \\u2013 JEE Main response sheet is different from what students actually filled in many cases + lot of answers wrongly given by NTA.\\u201d\\n\\nRESPONSE SHEET MESS ADDS TO STUDENTS\\u2019 WORRIES\\n\\nThe issue goes beyond just the answer key. Several candidates and their parents reported major errors in the response sheets shared by NTA. Some students said their selected answers were wrongly recorded, while others found the sheets showing blank responses.\\n\\nPramod Kamath, who is also a parent, posted on social media, \\u201cIndeed my daughter attempted 71 questions. During submission it showed 71 questions attempted & now in the response sheet it is showing all questions as unanswered! Shocking! NTA is playing with the future of children. No response on email!\\u201d\\n\\nAnother student, who appeared for the April 3 shift 2 exam, said he had selected the first option for a physics question, but the response sheet now shows the second option.\\n\\nOne parent, Rekha Verma, wrote on X, \\u201cMy daughter has attempted 50 questions but it is showing 48. So many questions showing the wrong attempt. We will mail to NTA for this blunder. I am very worried for her.\\u201d\\n\\nA different user added, \\u201cActually we are also experiencing similar issue on answer sheet shared by NTA. We request to the management to review and publish error free results.\\u201d\\n\\nA mother whose daughter regularly scored between 180-190 in practice tests said her child\\u2019s answer sheet now shows several incorrect options that were not marked by her.\\n\\n'BLANK' ANSWERS AND UNRESPONSIVE NTA\\n\\nSome students even reported that the system simply didn\\u2019t record their answers at all. One X user shared, \\u201cAnswers submitted were not considered and shows up as \\u2018blank\\u2019. An email to NTA went unanswered. Ridiculous that they conduct an exam for such premier institutes and are least bothered about the transparency. Who will guard the guards?\\u201d\\n\\nIn another post, someone said the same issue occurred with his sister\\u2019s paper -- one question was missing her chosen answer entirely.\\n\\nOPPOSITION LEADERS JOIN IN, QUESTION NTA\\u2019S CREDIBILITY\\n\\nAs reports of errors spread, political leaders also stepped in, questioning the NTA\\u2019s ability to conduct high-stakes exams.\\n\\nReferring to the TOI report, Congress leader Supriya Shrinate posted in Hindi on X:\\n\\n\\u201cThe NTA is already facing questions over the conduct of competitive exams \\u2013 last year's CUET-UG, NEET-UG answer sheets also had errors. Is the NTA capable of conducting these exams? Was the tension of unemployment and paper leaks not enough for our youth that now they have to deal with a weak NTA as well?\\u201d\\n\\nWHAT NEXT FOR STUDENTS?\\n\\nThe window to challenge the JEE Main 2025 Session 2 answer key has already closed, and the results are expected by April 17. But with so many discrepancies raised -- from factual errors to technical glitches -- students are demanding that the NTA drop the flawed questions or award bonus marks.\\n\\nSo far, there\\u2019s been no official response from the agency. With lakhs of students depending on this exam to secure a place in top engineering colleges, the silence is only fuelling anxiety.\\n\\nAll eyes are now on the NTA -- will it admit to the issues and act, or leave students to bear the consequences?\\n\\nPublished By: Roshni Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"Union minister Kiren Rijiju defended the recent amendments to the Waqf Act, arguing the changes were necessary to prevent arbitrary land grabs and address long-standing grievances.\\n\\nSpeaking in Kerala on Tuesday, Union Minister Kiren Rijiju said the move was vital to protecting people\\u2019s rights over their land. \\u201cLand is the most precious thing. Many countries go to war for it. We must protect every inch for its rightful owner,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nRijiju criticised the past provisions of the Act for giving \\u201cunprecedented powers\\u201d to Waqf boards, which he alleged had been misused in several cases\\u2014including the Munambam land dispute in Kerala.\\n\\nThe Munambam case, where the Kerala Waqf Board declared 404 acres as Waqf property, allegedly depriving over 600 fishermen of ownership, was a focal point of his address. Rijiju called it a \\u201ctragedy\\u201d and promised justice. \\u201cThe government will ensure such cases do not happen again,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nHe said that as part of the reforms, the Centre has struck down Section 40 of the Act, which had empowered Waqf Boards to unilaterally declare any land as Waqf. \\u201cNo authority should have uncontrolled power. All future surveys will be led by the District Collector and based strictly on government records,\\u201d Rijiju said.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nHe flagged the scale of unchecked claims, stating that over 18 lakh properties were declared as Waqf between 2013 and 2025. \\u201cIf we don\\u2019t act now, people will continue losing ownership. Once declared Waqf, it\\u2019s irreversible\\u2014that cannot continue,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nThe amended law now makes a registered Waqf deed mandatory for any claim. It also bars the declaration of disputed or sub-judice land as Waqf. Another major change is the removal of the \\u201cWaqf by user\\u201d clause, which allowed claims without documentation. \\u201cThat was dangerous,\\u201d Rijiju said.\\n\\nThe Minister also announced that all state Waqf boards and tribunals will be reconstituted. Explaining the legal premise, he said, \\u201cIf a Waqif dedicates a property, then it becomes Waqf\\u2014but it cannot be transferred. That\\u2019s the core of the Munambam issue. It can be challenged.\\u201d\\n\\nTaking aim at the Congress, Rijiju said the 2013 amendments made by the party allowed sweeping Waqf claims. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve now brought in strict safeguards,\\u201d he said. The new law also allows appeals against Waqf Tribunal decisions in High Courts and restructures board and tribunal composition.\\n\\nRijiju said he would visit Munambam later that evening to meet affected residents. Referring to a case involving Mohammad Siddiqui Sait, he said, \\u201cOnce land is transferred, it is no longer Waqf. The High Court ruling can be challenged in the Supreme Court.\\u201d\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nHe urged the Kerala government to act swiftly. \\u201cWe\\u2019re in a federal setup. We\\u2019ve made the law, now the state must implement it. The Centre will provide all legal and administrative support to help people reclaim their land.\\u201d\\n\\nAddressing concerns that the amendments target Muslims, Rijiju said, \\u201cThere\\u2019s a false campaign claiming we\\u2019re anti-Muslim. In fact, crores of poor Muslims have also been denied Waqf benefits. The majority get nothing. This law is not against any community.\\u201d\\n\\nHe also flagged other alleged overreaches. \\u201cIn some instances, Waqf Boards have unilaterally declared entire villages and even Parliament as Waqf property. One person even claimed a third of Delhi. These kinds of unlimited claims will no longer be allowed. Our position is very clear.\\u201d\\n\\nPublished By: Afreen Published On: Apr 15, 2025\\n\\nTune In\",\n",

The introduction of tripartite partnerships between universities, students, and industry, is expected to make education more inclusive, practical, and outcome-driven.\\n\\nIndian organizations engaged nearly one million apprentices in 2023\\u201324 (a 26 fold jump in the last five years) yet they constitute just 0.18% of the workforce, compared to 2%-3% engagement in developed countries. Scaling the AEDP model is essential to bridge India\\u2019s employability gap, considering that only 54.81% of youth are deemed employable.\\n\\nFor universities, success depends on three interventions: strong industry partnerships, robust curriculums embedded with apprenticeships, and governance for tracking and mentorship. Operational readiness\\u2014faculty training, curriculum redesign, and alignment with sector skill councils\\u2014is critical. Partnering with established Third Party Aggregators, who have the requisite experience for managing apprenticeship lifecycles, would be a key area to becoming AEDP ready.\\n\\nWith 12 million youth entering the workforce each year, AEDP offers a pragmatic path to prepare them for rapidly evolving business needs. Unlocking this potential will require policy support and institutional agility to truly harness India\\u2019s demographic dividend.\\n\\n(The author is the Chief Executive Officer, TeamLease Degree Apprenticeship)\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"Silence can be dehumanising. Nothing can match a chief minister's shocking silence over people being hacked to death or hundreds forced to flee for fear of being killed in a communal pogrom. That's what West Bengal is witnessing as Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and other Trinamool Congress leaders appeal to the aggressors, while not sparing a thought for the victims.\\n\\nRealpolitik and pragmatism should stop at the doors of death at least.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThat West Bengal is a communal cauldron in which parties have parboiled their politics is stating the obvious. But allowing mobs of a community to run riot for days shows both administrative lethargy and political licence. Then comes the abject apathy towards thousands of victims.\\n\\nWest Bengal has seen the most violent protests against the new waqf law that resulted in deaths and people fleeing their homes. Though protests erupted in several states, including Kerala, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh, no state burnt like Bengal did.\\n\\nThe timeline shows that the protests were preplanned. It also shows either a failure in the state's intelligence-gathering mechanism, or it's allowing a free run to communal mobs.\\n\\nThe Waqf Amendment Bill, 2025, was passed on April 4, and received the President's nod on April 5. Large-scale violent protests in West Bengal started only on April 11, after the Friday prayers.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nProtesters clashed with police, set fire to the homes and businesses of Hindus and looted shops. A father-son duo -- Horogobindo and Chandan Das -- were hacked to death in Mushidabad, a Muslim-majority district and epicentre of the rioting.\\n\\nA mob broke into the home of the artisans, dragged the two out, and hacked them to death even as the women of the family fell on the feet of the attackers in a desperate bid to save the men.\\n\\nHundreds of Hindus of Murshidabad, mostly women and children, fled their homes using boats to cross the Ganga to Malda.\\n\\nThe videos are out there -- people claiming the West Bengal police didn't act against the aggressors, and remained mute spectators. That, despite hours of calling police stations, there was no help and that they were left to be the prey of marauding mobs.\\n\\nThe violence continued for a second day on Saturday, and it was only after the intervention of the Calcutta High Court that central forces were deployed in rioting-hit areas of West Bengal. Incidents of violence were reported on Monday from South 24 Parganas, the district adjoining Kolkata.\\n\\nAll through the pogrom, Mamata Banerjee and other Trinamool leaders kept dealing with the rioters with kid gloves.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nOn Saturday, Mamata declared that she wouldn't be implementing the new waqf law in West Bengal. She was addressing the rioters in violence-hit areas of Murshidabad district, appealing for peace.\\n\\n\\\"We have made our position clear on this matter - we do not support this law. This law will not be implemented in our state. So what is the riot about?\\\" Mamata wrote on X.\\n\\n\\\"My sincere appeal to all people of all religions, please remain calm, remain restrained. Do not engage in any unrighteous behaviour in the name of religion. Every human life is precious. Do not incite riots for the sake of politics. Those who are inciting riots are harming the society,\\\" she further stressed.\\n\\nTrinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra appealed to Muslims with \\\"folded hands\\\" for peace. The Krishnanagar MP said she had filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court against the new law.\\n\\n\\\"Like we didn't allow NRC on the soil of Bengal, the Mamata Banerjee government wouldn't allow the waqf law to be implemented,\\\" Moitra said in a video appeal to Muslims.\\n\\nThe BJP said that no TMC minister had been arrested for inciting violence against Hindus. \\\"Because under Mamata Banerjee, hate against Hindus isn\\u2019t a crime -- it\\u2019s a strategy,\\\" it said.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nMuslims have been one of the core voter segments for the Trinamool Congress. And given the state's demography, it is a crucial vote base.\\n\\nMuslims comprised 27% of Bengal's population, according to the 2011 Census.\\n\\nAIMIM leader Imran Solanki had in March claimed that Muslims constituted 40% of Bengal's population. Last year, Kolkata Mayor and Bengal Cabinet minister Firhad Hakim said that Muslims were 33% of the state's population.\\n\\nOn the 400 Hindu families forced to flee from their homes, as BJP leader Amit Malviya claimed, TMC's Firhad Hakim said, \\\"People are relocating within Bengal, not fleeing the state. It is because West Bengal is safe that they are staying within the state.\\\" Earlier, BJP MLA Suvendu Adhikari had claimed that \\\"more than 400 Hindus from Dhulian, Murshidabad,\\\" were forced to flee the riots.\\n\\nHakim, echoed his leader Mamata Banerjee, and urged the mob to head to Delhi to protest, where the Waqf Act was passed.\\n\\n\\\"Today, they belittle exodus. Tomorrow, they will normalise extermination,\\\" said Amit Malviya, BJP's IT cell chief, slamming Hakim for branding the crisis as \\\"intra-state migration\\\".\\n\\nWhat makes the tragedy of Hindus being forced to flee their homes worse is that Bengalis across the world are celebrating April 15 as Noboborsho, the Bengali new year.\\n\\nDespite killings of Hindus and destruction of their homes and businesses by Muslim mobs, there has been no strong condemnation or display of intent from the Trinamool leadership. They have either appeared with folded hands or tried to use kid gloves for violent mobs. Such mollycoddling will not only encourage the aggressors, it will alienate the Hindus of the state.\\n\\nPublished By: Sushim Mukul Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"A Congress MLA in Tamil Nadu, Hasan Maulana, assured residents that no one would be evicted from a Vellore village where a dargah had issued eviction notices after claiming the land as Waqf property.\\n\\nHowever, he added that villagers would be required to pay a nominal rent if the Waqf Board\\u2019s claim to the land is substantiated by supporting documents. \\u201cOnce a Waqf, always a Waqf,\\u201d Maulana said.\\n\\nHis remarks came after about 150 families in Kattukollai village, in Vellore district, reportedly received notices stating that their land belongs to the Waqf.\\n\\nThe notices were issued by a person named F Syed Satham, who claimed that the land in Kattukollai belongs to a local dargah. India Today accessed a notice sent by Satham to a man named Balaji, accusing him of encroaching on Waqf land registered under survey number 362. According to the notice, Balaji had constructed a house and a shop on the property, which, as per Waqf records, belongs to the mosque.\\n\\nThe notice stated that residents must seek permission, pay ground rent, and comply with Waqf laws\\u2014or face legal eviction.\\n\\nSyed Sadam, who became caretaker of the dargah and mosque following his father's death in 2021, claims the land has belonged to the Waqf Board since 1954 and says they have documents to prove it.\\n\\nAccording to Sadam, his late father lacked formal education and awareness and therefore did not collect rent from those living on the land. Now, Sadam says he intends to rectify this by collecting rent from the residents.\\n\\nHe stated that two more notices will be sent, and if there is no response, the matter will be taken to the High Court.\\n\\nThe residents, however, say they have lived on the land for four generations and consider it their own. They are upset that Sadam is now demanding rent, whereas his father never did.\\n\\nThe issue gained attention when concerned villagers gathered at the District Collector\\u2019s office fearing eviction. Praveen Kumar, Divisional Secretary of the Hindu Munnani, said all 150 families had received similar notices, despite having government-issued documents and paying panchayat taxes. He urged the Collector to grant official land titles (patta) to the villagers, who are anxious about losing their homes and livelihoods.\\n\\nAccording to the residents, the Vellore District Collector has informally advised them not to pay rent for now.\\n\\nThis is the second such Tamil Nadu village that has been claimed by the Waqf law. Previously, a Tiruchendurai village was also sent similar notices saying the land belonged to Waqf board.\\n\\nPublished By: Preeja Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

He was sold as a baby for just 50 yuan (around Rs 600), but today, he\\u2019s the man behind a company earning over $410 million a year. His journey from hardship to huge success shows what grit, smart thinking, and a little rebellion against the norm can really do, reported South China Morning Post.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nNow 67, Niu is the founder of Mengniu Dairy\\u2014one of China\\u2019s biggest dairy companies\\u2014and the brain behind Aice, a renowned ice cream brand in Southeast Asia.\\n\\nNiu was born into a poor family in Inner Mongolia. His parents couldn\\u2019t afford to raise him, so they sold him to a cattle farmer. The farmer adopted him, but life was still full of challenges.\\n\\nAt the age of eight, Niu was forced to sweep the streets and do heavy labour after his adoptive father lost everything in a political dispute. Not long after, both his adoptive parents passed away.\\n\\nIn 1983, Niu found a job as a bottle washer in a small dairy factory. That same factory would later grow into Yili, one of China\\u2019s top dairy brands. Niu worked hard, learnt the ropes, and eventually became Vice-President of Production and Operations. At his peak, he was earning over a million yuan a year.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nBut success didn\\u2019t stop the challenges. Office politics and rising competition made things tough, and Niu decided to step away.\\n\\nIn 1999, Niu took a brave step. With 10 million yuan in hand, he launched Mengniu Dairy. His previous employer, Yili, was already worth over a billion yuan at that time. But Niu had a different approach\\u2014he focused on rural areas, advertised in local languages, and kept his products affordable. People connected with his brand, and by 2005, Mengniu became China\\u2019s top dairy name.\\n\\nNot stopping there, Niu looked to Southeast Asia. In 2015, he launched Aice in Indonesia, an ice cream brand made for everyone. His goal was simple: make good quality ice cream affordable for all.\\n\\nWith prices between Rs 5 to Rs 9, Aice offered popular flavours like durian and coconut milk coffee. Niu also helped local shopkeepers by giving them free freezers and subsidising electricity costs. This made Aice a hit\\u2014now it operates in over 1,200 districts across Indonesia and leads the region\\u2019s ice cream market.\\n\\nHe supports medical care for critically ill children in Inner Mongolia and helps build schools across China.\",\n",

      "        \"title\": \"Why ICAI has decided to hold CA final exams thrice a year\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"Over the past decade, there has been a nearly 30% drop in student registrations \\u2014 from 3,11,000 in 2013 to just 2,24,000 in 2022.\\n\\nPhoto: Canva image\\n\\nIn a significant move towards reforming professional education in India, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has declared that, beginning in January 2025, the Chartered Accountancy (CA) Final examination will be held three times a year \\u2014 in January, May, and September. This brings the final level in line with the Foundation and Intermediate stages, which already follow a triannual exam pattern.\\n\\nThis decision has both strategic and student-centric motivations. One key factor is the increasing urgency to scale up the number of Chartered Accountants in the country. ICAI\\u2019s former President, Ranjeet Kumar Agarwal, highlighted that India will require over 30 lakh (3 million) CAs by 2047, to mark the 100th year of independence. Presently, the ICAI has around 4 lakh members and approximately 8.5 lakh active students. To meet the projected target, the country will need to produce more than 1.3 lakh qualified CAs each year \\u2014 a figure that makes the increase in exam frequency not only logical but necessary.\\n\\nAnother challenge that prompted this change is the decline in new enrolments into the CA course. Over the past decade, there has been a nearly 30% drop in student registrations \\u2014 from 3,11,000 in 2013 to just 2,24,000 in 2022. One of the key reasons is the growing popularity of global alternatives such as CPA, ACCA, and CFA, which offer higher pass percentages and more adaptable exam schedules. For instance, CFA\\u2019s pass rates stand at 45% for Level 1, 39% for Level 2, and 48% for Level 3. CPA typically sees success rates between 45% and 55%, and ACCA\\u2019s pass rates vary between 37% and 89% across its 13 papers. In contrast, the CA Final pass rate remains at a much tougher 13.44% (both groups), with Intermediate at 14.05% and Foundation at 21.52%.\\n\\nThe international context is also telling. Qualifications such as ACCA hold exams four times a year, the CPA follows a rolling schedule, and CFA exams are held between two and four times annually. The former twice-yearly model of CA exams had become an outlier. By moving to thrice-a-year attempts, ICAI is bridging that gap and aligning itself with global standards \\u2014 a step that will no doubt enhance its credibility on the world stage.\\n\\nBeyond numbers, the reform brings welcome relief to students. The current six-month gap between exam cycles often prolongs uncertainty and hampers momentum, especially for those who narrowly miss passing. With the reduced four-month interval between attempts, students can now regroup, re-evaluate, and reattempt within a shorter window. This change could significantly reduce the average time taken to complete the qualification. Additionally, ICAI has introduced multiple-choice questions (MCQs) across all papers at the Intermediate and Final stages, promoting clarity of concepts and encouraging analytical thinking.\\n\\nHowever, this increased flexibility comes with its own set of expectations. Students must avoid the temptation of attempting the exams prematurely and instead focus on solid, methodical preparation. The additional exam windows should be viewed as a chance to pace one\\u2019s studies, not to dilute the rigour of the course.\\n\\nThose who have experienced the grind of the CA journey \\u2014 the long hours, the repeated revisions, and the psychological toll of high-stakes exams \\u2014 will particularly appreciate the value of this reform. Earlier, a failed attempt often meant waiting six months to try again, which took an emotional toll. Now, with shorter wait times, aspirants have more opportunities to learn from setbacks and move forward with renewed determination.\",\n",

Sivankutty, has strongly criticised the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) for its latest decision to provide Hindi titles for English-medium textbooks. Calling the move a \\\"grave illogicality,\\\" Sivankutty accused the central government of imposing culture and denigrating India's rich linguistic diversity.\\n\\nThe Minister contended that substituting time-honored English titles with Hindi equivalents like Mridang, Santoor, and Poorvi for 1 to 6 classes is not just improper but also conveys a misguided message to young students. \\\"It is wrong to reject English titles that have been there for decades, particularly when they promote inclusivity and tolerance for language diversity in young minds,\\\" he stated on Monday.\\n\\nSivankutty emphasised that English-medium students should be given English titles, and he opined further that the title of textbooks contributes a lot towards children's imagination and worldview. He also cautioned that this action goes against federal principles and values of the Constitution.\\n\\nRatifying the views of other states that do not speak Hindi, he stated that Kerala was determined to uphold linguistic diversity and protect the cultural sovereignty of regions. \\\"Education must be a means to empowerment and respect for each other's languages, not a means for one language to dominate another,\\\" the Minister said.\\n\\nInviting collective resistance, Sivankutty called for NCERT to reverse and withdraw the changes, and appealed to all the states to stand together against what he described as \\\"unwarranted imposition\\\".\\n\\nThis controversy follows NCERT's launch of rechristened textbooks as per the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. The process of renaming has resurfaced language policy debates, with Kerala and Tamil Nadu leaders accusing the Centre of imposing Hindi through education reforms. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. K. Stalin has earlier expressed the same fears, condemning the Centre for not releasing funds to states that are reluctant to adopt the three-language formula under NEP.\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"Character development is emerging as the key to holistic education, preparing students not just for exams but for life in a complex, digital world.\\n\\nImage from canva\\n\\nAmid rapid technological advancement and increasing global complexity, education stakeholders are beginning to question the adequacy of traditional academic metrics like grades and standardized tests. There is a noticeable shift toward a more holistic view of student success\\u2014one that values intellectual achievements and the development of emotional and social competencies. This evolving perspective acknowledges that character is integral to long-term success. Consequently, character development is gradually being recognized not as a supplementary aspect of education but as a core component for preparing students for the demands of a dynamic and interconnected world.\\n\\nThe shift from IQ to EQ\\n\\nIn recent years, research and educational policies have increasingly emphasised that the intelligence quotient (IQ) alone does not define a student's potential. Emotional intelligence (EQ)\\u2014encompassing traits such as self-awareness, empathy, and self-regulation\\u2014and character attributes like curiosity, resilience, and determination have emerged as equally critical for academic and personal success.\\n\\nStudents with strong emotional and character skills are better equipped to navigate academic pressures, overcome setbacks, and stay motivated through challenges. These qualities also serve as protective factors for mental well-being, reducing the risk of stress, anxiety, and burnout. When schools deliberately foster character development and socio-emotional learning, they promote inner strength and build a supportive culture where students feel safe, respected, and empowered.\\n\\nThe classroom as a character lab\\n\\nProgressive educational institutions are increasingly embracing a comprehensive approach to character development, where classrooms function as laboratories for fostering vital life skills. This goes beyond merely occasional moral science classes or motivational speeches.\\n\\nInstead, it involves establishing a culture that integrates values such as respect, responsibility, and empathy into daily teaching and interactions. Collaborative projects, debates, and open discussions can encourage teamwork, empathy, and critical thinking, while supportive educators can assist students in learning from their mistakes and building resilience.\\n\\nNurturing character in the digital world\\n\\nIn the digital age, character development extends beyond physical classrooms and playgrounds into online interactions. Cultivating digital citizenship becomes essential as students increasingly engage with social media, collaborative tools, and digital platforms. This involves fostering responsible, respectful, and ethical behaviour in virtual environments\\u2014whether refraining from cyberbullying, respecting intellectual property, or maintaining honesty in online academic submissions.\\n\\nBy integrating digital responsibility into character education, schools can help students navigate the complexities of the digital world with integrity. Encouraging critical thinking about online behaviour strengthens students' moral compasses and prepares them to become thoughtful, empathetic contributors to the global digital community.\\n\\nHolistic education: An emerging trend\\n\\nA notable development in global education policy is the growing emphasis on holistic education, which seeks to cultivate students' intellectual, emotional, social, and ethical development. International bodies such as the OECD and UNESCO have underscored the importance of this paradigm, advocating for educational systems that not only equip learners with academic skills but also enable them to thrive in complex and dynamic contexts.\\n\\nReflecting the global shift toward holistic education, India\\u2019s National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 emphasizes value-based learning and integrating socio-emotional learning (SEL) into the curriculum. By moving beyond rote learning and exam-driven models, the policy aims to foster critical thinking, empathy, and ethical awareness\\u2014preparing students to become academically proficient, emotionally resilient, and socially responsible individuals.\\n\\nThe educator\\u2019s role: Shaping character through action\\n\\nEducators are central to a student\\u2019s character journey\\u2014not just as instructors but as role models and mentors. Their authenticity, fairness, and empathy set the tone for a positive, value-driven learning environment. Students often absorb these behaviors, making it crucial for teachers to lead by example.\\n\\nCharacter development also unfolds through how teachers face challenges, transform mistakes into learning opportunities, and promote respectful dialogue. Structured mentorship, peer support, and reflective activities enhance students' emotional and ethical growth. Educators help integrate character education into the school culture by collaborating with families and demonstrating consistency and values. Ultimately, their daily actions leave the most lasting impact on a student\\u2019s development.\\n\\nAs the world becomes more complex, education must evolve to address the full spectrum of human potential. While knowledge and technical skills can open doors, character\\u2014resilience, empathy, integrity, and purpose\\u2014ultimately determines how far a student will go. Institutions that nurture intellectual and moral development empower learners to succeed academically and thrive as responsible, adaptable citizens in a rapidly changing world.\\n\\nThe time has come to reimagine classrooms as spaces where values are lived, not merely taught. When educators lead purposefully, mindfully utilize digital platforms, and prioritize mental well-being alongside academic rigor, we create an education system that prepares students for exams and life.\\n\\nThe author is the Dean (Training), Chair (Placement & Corporate Relations), Assistant Professor (Business Analytics), Jaipuria Institute of Management, Jaipur.\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"In a rapidly evolving business world, personalised coaching provides real-time, emotionally intelligent support that bridges the gap between knowledge and action\\u2014giving entrepreneurs the clarity, confidence, and edge to lead effectively.\\n\\nPhoto: Canva image\\n\\nIn a world where industries take overnight turns and decisions need to be made in real time, business leaders are more frequently looking for support beyond the traditional establishment of education. MBAs and structured programmes still have a place in this conversation; they provide foundational understanding, strategic frameworks, and access to useful networks or opportunities. However, they do not always attend to the urgency, uniqueness, and emotional complexity that an entrepreneur experiences in real time.\\n\\nThis is where personalised 1-on-1 coaching fits in\\u2014not as a replacement for, or a shortage of, valuable education, but as the edge many entrepreneurs now recognise as necessary. Once thought of as a value-add or last-resort addition, coaching has become a pragmatic strategic investment made by founders who want to grow and evolve in their role with clarity, speed, and confidence.\\n\\nA different kind of growth tool\\n\\nEntrepreneurs today face considerably more than predictable strategy. They must continuously have the capacity to adapt in real time, lead through uncertainty, and make decisions with imperfect information. In many cases, an educational background in business is not designed for such fluidity.\\n\\nCoaching is inherently directed at the present, tailored to the founder\\u2019s specific context, industry, leadership style, and objectives. Whether the aim is to scale faster, expand the business footprint, or make an outright directional shift, 1-on-1 coaching will focus the entrepreneur on achieving the outcome they are pursuing.\\n\\nNot a service for the stuck, but fuel for the fast movers\\n\\nThere can be a false sense that coaching is only for people who are struggling or in pain. In our day and age, that is far from the truth. More and more high-performing entrepreneurs are looking for coaches not because they are failing, but because they want to grow differently.\\n\\nFor some, it is about speed\\u2014providing acceleration for growth. For others, it is about width\\u2014offering a greater vision. And for many, it is about depth\\u2014aligning business goals and objectives with their personal hopes and dreams or being intentional about the culture they are building. You see, today's coach is not just a sounding board. A coach is often a strategic thought partner to help bring perspective, structure, and accountability.\\n\\nThe power of a non-judgemental fellow traveller\\n\\nBeing an entrepreneur can be an overwhelming experience. Even in rooms filled with other employees, partners, or investors, a founder may struggle to be candid about their doubts, fears, or possible decisions. It is often difficult to find a place to sort through all these thoughts without judgement or fear of ramifications.\\n\\nThis is where a coach is uniquely positioned\\u2014somebody who is outside of the company but passionately committed to the founder's success. A fellow traveller who can share in the highs and lows while providing clarity without an agenda. With a coach, an entrepreneur can think out loud, challenge themselves, or reset when necessary\\u2014all while being free of the pressure to perform.\\n\\nFrom learning to action\\n\\nA regular dysfunction in conventional learning environments is the time lag between learning and doing. Knowledge is important, but it is action that drives results. The value of coaching for clients is in creating a bridge from conversation to plan, and from plan to action and outcomes\\u2014with effective accountability built into the process.\\n\\nAdditionally, coaching evolves adaptively throughout the year. Strategies are revisited, priorities recalibrated, and wins celebrated\\u2014not just quarterly, but weekly. This regular rhythm of applied learning creates not only effective coaching, but sustainable coaching.\\n\\nThe future is personalised\\n\\nThe issue isn\\u2019t whether an MBA or advanced education is worthwhile\\u2014it generally is. But the world of entrepreneurship is changing, and what leaders need now is customised, real-time, emotionally intelligent support. Coaching provides that advantage. In today\\u2019s world, 1-on-1 coaching is not a sign of weakness. It\\u2019s an indication of purposeful leadership. For a professional entrepreneur acting in a complicated environment, it\\u2019s no longer a luxury, but a tactic.\\n\\n(The author is a Business & Leadership Coach)\",\n",

Companies that once prioritised academic qualifications from top institutions are now rethinking how they identify talent. Skills\\u2014particularly those that match real-time business needs\\u2014are taking centre stage. Whether it is in AI, cybersecurity, or green tech, recruiters are leaning toward a more agile, outcomes-based approach to talent acquisition.\\n\\nThis change is rooted both in trend and necessity. According to Mercer | Mettl, only 45 per cent of recent graduates have the skills employers seek. The lag between education and industry expectations is increasing, as companies rush to implement next-gen technologies without the workforce to support them.\\n\\nThe World Economic Forum projects that by 2025, 97 million new roles will emerge globally, powered by AI, robotics, and IoT.\\n\\nRahul Veerwal, CEO and co-founder of GetWork, explains how this shift is unfolding in real time, \\u201cAt GetWork, we have witnessed how AI is rapidly driving the shift toward skill-based hiring by empowering companies to assess candidates on real-world capabilities rather than just academic credentials. Technology is uncovering hidden talent in Tier 2 and 3 cities\\u2014individuals who may lack elite degrees but have the skills to excel. This evolution is making the hiring process more inclusive, efficient, and aligned with the demands of the modern workforce.\\u201d\\n\\nA LinkedIn report, India Future of Recruiting 2023, found that 75 per cent of recruiters now believe skills-first hiring is the next step. For technology roles, employers are targeting proficiencies in data science, machine learning, blockchain, and cloud infrastructure\\u2014areas that often require hands-on exposure rather than just theory.\\n\\nKorn Ferry\\u2019s research reinforces this shift, indicating that organisations hiring based on skills are 57 per cent more likely to adapt to changes and meet evolving challenges effectively. These organisations are hiring talent that can transition across roles, collaborate across disciplines, and think beyond traditional job descriptions.\\n\\nReflecting on this transition from the skilling side, JPS Kohli, Founder & Group CEO, SkillUp noted, \\u201cAt SkillUp, we believe the future of hiring belongs to those who can do, not just those who know. The industry is moving beyond traditional degrees towards skills that speak for themselves. Today\\u2019s employers need talent that is ready to deliver from day one, with real-world experience and problem-solving ability. That is why our learning approach is deeply learner-centric \\u2014 focused on outcomes, flexibility, and partnerships with global tech leaders.\\u201d\\n\\nThis whole shift is tied closely to how fast digital transformation is happening. AI, for example, is being picked up across industries, with sectors like BFSI and tech moving fastest.\\n\\nMeanwhile, hiring patterns across sectors are also reflecting the move to specialized skillsets. IT firms are scouting for talent in programming and AI integration; Fintech wants blockchain engineers and cybersecurity professionals, while investment banks are on the lookout for data analysts and algorithm specialists. In each case, the capability to solve problems and innovate in real-time outweighs the need for academic laurels.\\n\\nThis has prompted education and skilling platforms to rethink how they structure their offerings. Industry-led certifications, boot camps, and apprenticeship programs are now becoming viable alternatives to full-time degrees. Some platforms are designing learning experiences around real-world scenarios, often teaming up with industry players to make it as practical as possible.\\n\\nThe push toward this model is also helping address regional talent disparities. As Rahul Veerwal of GetWork points out, AI-powered recruitment tools are enabling employers to tap into previously overlooked talent pools in smaller cities. This is making the tech hiring process not only more accurate but also more democratic.\\n\\nRecruitment models are also evolving to support this change. Tech-driven assessments, scenario-based evaluations, and AI-enabled screening tools are replacing conventional resumes and interviews. Companies are increasingly offering \\u201ctrial projects\\u201d or gig-based evaluations before making full-time offers\\u2014giving candidates the opportunity to demonstrate their skills directly.\\n\\nWhat\\u2019s unfolding is a redefinition of merit. For today\\u2019s tech employers, it is not about where a candidate studied\\u2014it is about what they can contribute from the start. For candidates\\u2019 skills are the ticket to long-term career relevance.\\n\\n\",\n",

      "        \"title\": \"Equity over inclusion: The role of mentorship and returnship for women in tech\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"Mentorship and returnship programmes are transforming the workplace into a space where everyone can thrive.\\n\\nImage by canva\\n\\nTalent is spread across a diverse spectrum, and to thrive in the competitive market, organisations today need to be well-prepared to embrace & harness this diversity to deliver more together. While the Indian technology sector has experienced a positive increase in the number of women in the field, the representation of women in decision-making, innovation, and research-based roles is still limited. These gaps call for a shift beyond Diversity and Inclusion.\\n\\nTrue progress needs ''Equity,'' ensuring that women have the resources, opportunities, and systemic support they need to grow at every stage of their careers. It's recognising the unique challenges women face and providing the resources, opportunities, and support needed to thrive rather than expecting them to navigate barriers on their own. In the end, we need a diverse range of perspectives that lead to more balanced and sustainable decisions.\\n\\nEmployers investing in growth opportunities for women unlock great potential, driving innovation and strengthening their workforce.\\n\\nInitiatives such as mentorship, returnships, leadership development programmes, upkilling and reskilling, employee resource groups, women's leadership groups, or even an in-house creche can create pathways for career advancement. By implementing initiatives like the above, companies can empower women leaders and build a more inclusive and dynamic workplace.\\n\\nThe power of mentorship\\n\\nEffective mentorship goes beyond traditional learning - it inspires, connects, and drives lasting change. When organisations cultivate a strong culture of mentorship, they enable an environment where everyone feels supported, grows together, and makes a meaningful impact.\\n\\nMentorship can come in many forms. From senior mentorship, peer-to-peer guidance, or reverse mentorship, all these relationships enable continuous learning in the workplace and ensure that everyone progresses together.\\n\\nMany companies like Hexagon R&D India have recognised the power of mentorship. They are integrating it into their culture through structured programs. Our Programs like MentHer connect women with mentors for guidance and networking, while the Gengage program facilitates reverse mentorship between Gen-Z employees and senior leaders and the WILL Program connects women with a supportive peer network for collaboration.\\n\\nA well-structured mentorship program is crucial for women navigating male-dominated tech world. It's not just about guidance, it\\u2019s about empowerment. Investing in it not only strengthens the leadership pipeline but also drives innovation and a forward-thinking organisation.\\n\\nThink of a workplace where women have access to experienced mentors who support their aspirations and offer insights, encouragement, and direction. It\\u2019s a space where they can openly share experiences and challenges with senior professionals, learning from their journeys. This kind of network accelerates personal and professional development and continuous learning.\\n\\nAlso, it is great for everyone involved. Having mentored two women leaders every quarter, for many years, I've seen firsthand how mentorship is mutually rewarding. Additionally, the impact extends beyond individual relationships, creating an environment with free-flowing knowledge and multiplying opportunities.\\n\\nEffective mentorship should go beyond traditional learning and aim to inspire, connect, and create lasting change. A workplace that prioritises mentorship is not just nurturing talent, it is shaping the leaders of tomorrow.\\n\\nNew pathway forward with returnship programmes\\n\\nCareer breaks are common, and they could be for various reasons like motherhood, caregiving, mental health, or just a break. Yet, these breaks are often viewed as taboo, with organisations still hesitant to hire women who have taken a break. What we tend to overlook is that returning candidates often come back stronger and more well-rounded, with renewed energy and broader perspectives. As technology evolves rapidly, adapting to new skills and tools should not be a challenge for them.\\n\\nReturnship programmes provide a valuable opportunity to help diverse candidates transition back into the workforce, bringing fresh insights, energy, and experiences. Embracing this talent pool drives inclusivity and taps into an underutilised resource of capable professionals eager to contribute.\\n\\nOrganisations, including Hexagon R&D India, are proactively supporting professionals returning to the workforce. One such initiative is the Begin.Again program, designed to help women transition back after a career break. Through highly paid internships and a guaranteed full-time offer upon successful completion, the programme provides an inclusive and supportive pathway to re-enter the workforce.\\n\\nAt Hexagon R&D India, we have a no-questions policy, meaning we do not enquire about the reasons behind a woman's career break. Through this approach, we ensure that returning candidates are not judged on their gaps solely on their capabilities and potential.\\n\\nThe success of Begin Again has been remarkable, with candidates who have taken breaks of up to 14 years achieving conversion rates of over 90 per cent into full-time roles. Additionally, these returning colleagues show higher levels of engagement and often become champions of workplace inclusivity, further enriching the organisational culture.\\n\\nWhen organisations invest in meaningful reintegration, they unlock untapped potential and strengthen their workforce in the future.\\n\\nA call to action\\n\\nEquity is a mindset that drives change. We need to create workplaces where everyone can lead, innovate and thrive. Companies that take action will not only drive diversity but also a stronger more dynamic industry for the future.\\n\\nThe author is the Senior Vice President and Head, Hexagon R&D India.\",\n",

      "        \"title\": \"AI for the Win: How PwDs are benefiting from AI Tools\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"AI is breaking digital barriers and redefining accessibility, empowering persons with disabilities to thrive and lead in an inclusive digital world.\\n\\nImage from canva\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is at the forefront of global innovation, driving advancements across various sectors. According to PwC projections, AI is expected to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Industries have transformed through AI to deliver better results and improved user experiences. AI's impact on accessibility solutions is no exception. It has made significant strides in enhancing accessibility and improving the user experience, especially for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs).\\n\\nWhile organisations and society have made progress in physical accessibility, digital accessibility still lags behind. Efforts have been made, but much more is needed. In this age, digital platforms are now the most popular and convenient way to consume information, and barriers to digital accessibility hinder the growth of PwDs. Limited access to digital resources poses significant challenges for PwDs, affecting their ability to access essential services such as education, employment, and information. According to the WHO, nearly 1.3 billion people worldwide, or 16% of the global population, experience some form of disability. For this large population, digital accessibility is not a luxury but a necessity.\\n\\nAI as an enabler for accessibility\\n\\nAI-powered accessibility solutions play a crucial role in creating an inclusive environment for individuals with disabilities. These solutions enhance navigation, usability, and communication, catering to diverse needs. By leveling the playing field, AI empowers PwDs to pursue growth and development opportunities.\\n\\nHere are some ways AI-powered solutions enable accessibility and foster inclusivity:\\n\\nTransformative AI Technologies for Accessibility\\n\\na) AI and assistive technologies\\n\\nAI has transformed the landscape of assistive technologies, presenting significant advancements for PwDs. Amid these advancements, text-to-speech cloning technology stands out as a game-changer.

This not only accelerates interactions but also reduces the cognitive burden, streamlining the entire communication process. For people who may struggle with traditional input methods, AI's intuitive prediction mechanisms can anticipate their needs and facilitate a smoother exchange of ideas. This aspect of AI is a crucial development in making digital communication more accessible.\\n\\nc) Automated testing and scanning\\n\\nAutomated AI scanners play an essential role in detecting accessibility issues on websites. By performing extensive tests aligned with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), these tools streamline compliance efforts and improve usability, promoting a more inclusive digital experience.\\n\\nEnhancing digital experiences with AI\\n\\na) Improved virtual assistance\\n\\nAI-powered virtual assistants such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant have become tools of utmost importance for the PwD individuals. These AI assistants offer personalised solutions, adapting to the preferences and needs of various user groups. Right from controlling smart home devices to setting up alarm clocks, these virtual assistants make lives easier for PwDs.\\n\\nb)Better audio and video captioning\\n\\nAI excels in generating real-time captions for audio and video content. Automated transcription tools and advanced lip-reading capabilities provide crucial support for individuals with hearing impairments, ensuring they can access and engage with multimedia content.\\n\\nc) Image recognition and alt-text generation\\n\\nAI-powered image recognition technology automatically generates alt-text for images, enabling visually impaired users to understand visual content. This capability bridges accessibility gaps by offering real-time descriptions, making digital content more inclusive and informative.\\n\\nAI is poised to revolutionise accessibility for PwDs, unlocking new possibilities for a fully inclusive workforce. By seamlessly eliminating digital barriers, AI will enable organisations to create dynamic, forward-thinking workplaces where PwDs can thrive with equal opportunities for growth alongside their peers. With advanced tools, personalised training, and adaptive technologies, companies will empower PwDs to deliver groundbreaking results. Embracing digital accessibility is not just a progressive step; it is an essential part of shaping the future of work in a truly inclusive world.\\n\\nThe author is the Executive Vice President \\u2013 Global Corporate Communications, CSR, DEI and ESG, HGS\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"edForce is transforming workforce development by aligning training with business goals, and adapting upskilling to meet sector-specific demands.\\n\\nImage from canva\\n\\nBusinesses are constantly searching for methods to upskill their employees and keep up with technical breakthroughs in the quickly changing employment market of today. With an increasing emphasis on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and digital transformation, organisations across various industries are striving to bridge the skill gap. edForce, India\\u2019s leading workforce upskilling accelerator, has positioned itself as a pioneer in providing tailored training solutions that cater to the specific needs of diverse industries.\\n\\nUnderstanding industry-specific needs\\n\\nOne of edForce\\u2019s key strengths lies in its ability to assess and understand the unique learning and development (L&D) requirements of different industries. Whether it is IT, manufacturing, healthcare, retail, or finance, each sector has distinct skill demands. To address these, edForce employs its specialised Training Need Analysis (TNA) framework, which helps identify existing skill gaps and curate training programmes accordingly.\\n\\nFor instance, while IT companies may require advanced training in cloud computing, cybersecurity, and AI, manufacturing firms might seek expertise in automation, IoT, and robotics. edForce takes these specific needs into account and offers customised learning modules that align with industry trends and business goals.\\n\\nCustom-built learning solutions\\n\\nUnlike traditional training providers that offer generic courses, edForce develops bespoke learning solutions tailored to an organisation\\u2019s unique objectives. These solutions are meticulously designed by collaborating with industry leaders and subject matter experts. Some of the ways edForce personalises its training programs include:\\n\\n1. Customised Course Content \\u2013 Training modules are tailored to align with the latest technological advancements and business requirements of the respective industries.\\n\\n2. Role-Specific Training \\u2013 Programs are structured to meet the needs of different roles within an organisation, ensuring relevance and applicability.\\n\\n3. Live and On-Demand Learning \\u2013 A mix of instructor-led live sessions and on-demand content ensures flexibility for working professionals.\\n\\n4. Hands-On Labs and Simulations \\u2013 edForce provides CloudLabs, enabling employees to gain real-world experience in a controlled environment.\\n\\n5. Assessment and Certification \\u2013 To ensure competency and knowledge retention, edForce integrates assessments and globally recognised certifications into its training programmes.\\n\\nA partner in learning and development\\n\\nWhat sets edForce apart is its end-to-end ownership of the training cycle. Instead of merely offering a trainer and content, the company assumes full responsibility for managing the entire learning journey. This approach allows businesses to focus on their core operations while edForce takes care of training execution, tracking, and impact measurement.\\n\\nAdditionally, edForce\\u2019s deep engagement with businesses ensures that upskilling efforts are aligned with the company\\u2019s strategic vision. By acting as an extended L&D arm, the platform helps organisations build a sustainable learning culture that drives long-term growth.\\n\\nExpanding horizons: Beyond IT\\n\\nWhile edForce has established a strong presence in the IT sector, the company is now expanding into non-IT industries such as banking, healthcare, and retail. By doing so, it is widening its course offerings to address emerging needs in these sectors. For example:\\n\\nBanking & Finance \\u2013 Training in fintech, blockchain, and risk management.\\n\\nHealthcare \\u2013 Upskilling in healthcare analytics, digital health solutions, and AI-driven diagnostics.\\n\\nRetail & E-commerce \\u2013 Courses in supply chain analytics, customer data management, and AI-driven personalisation.\\n\\nPartnership with industry leaders\\n\\nA crucial factor that enables edForce to deliver top-tier upskilling solutions is its collaboration with leading global enterprises. By forging strong partnerships with industry giants such as Infosys, Walmart, Siemens, Microsoft, Dell, and Amazon, edForce designs and delivers training programs that directly align with the specific skill needs of these organisations. These partnerships not only reinforce edForce\\u2019s credibility as a premier upskilling provider but also ensure that learners receive industry-approved training that meets the highest global standards.\\n\\nFuture roadmap\\n\\nWith a remarkable YOY growth of over 500% and a recovering revenue of Rs 25 Cr. for FY 24-25, edForce is set to expand globally. The company is investing in technological infrastructure, AI-driven learning platforms, and strategic partnerships to enhance its training offerings further. As the demand for upskilling and reskilling continues to grow, edForce remains committed to delivering cutting-edge training solutions that empower businesses and professionals alike.\\n\\nedForce\\u2019s ability to deliver industry-specific, customised upskilling programs has positioned it as a leader in workforce development. By focusing on targeted skill enhancement, end-to-end training management, and real-world application, the company is effectively bridging the skills gap across multiple sectors. As edForce continues to innovate and expand, it is well on its way to redefining the future of professional learning and development in India and beyond.\\n\\nThe author is the CEO & Co-Founder of edForce.\",\n",

      "        \"title\": \"How affordable online MBA programs are transforming business education\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"The pursuit of an MBA program has long been a hallmark of career progression for business professionals. However, the costs of the traditional MBA route\\u2014including hefty tuition fees, relocation costs, and the opportunity cost of a career pause\\u2014have often deterred many from taking the plunge. The rise of online MBA programs has changed the landscape, offering a more flexible and cost-effective alternative without compromising quality or professional commitments.\\n\\nThe growing popularity of online MBA programs\\n\\nAs India aims to enroll 92 million students in higher education institutions by 2035, scalable and accessible learning solutions have become increasingly essential. Online MBA programs offer business professionals an opportunity to upskill without pausing their careers. With regulatory support reinforcing their credibility, these programs are now widely accepted. Over 500 UGC-approved online degree programs are currently offered by nearly 95 universities across India. Furthermore, the UGC has declared online degrees equivalent to traditional on-campus degrees in terms of academic rigor and professional recognition, making them a trusted option among employers. Unlike traditional programs that involve high campus maintenance and administrative costs, online\\n\\nMBA programs leverage digital platforms to reduce expenses. India\\u2019s digital expansion\\u2014marked by 1.2 billion smartphone users and an estimated 900 million internet users by the end of 2025\\u2014has further driven the accessibility and affordability of these programs.\\n\\nWhat makes an online MBA affordable?\\n\\nAn online MBA program\\u2019s trademark feature is affordability. Traditional institutions incur heavy costs for campus upkeep, staff housing, and administration expenses. However, online programs use digital platforms to provide qualitative education at much lower expenses, which becomes applicable to many students seeking financial assistance. The increased digital ecosystem available in India drastically improves affordability. With over a billion smartphone users, online education is simpler than ever. Since professionals from varying socioeconomic classes are now able to afford internet services, pursuing an online\\n\\nMBA without relocation or commuting is far from being a distant reality. The flexible structure of an online MBA further contributes to its affordability. With open-term dates, online MBA programs frequently use the modular method. Students have the flexibility to enroll in micro-courses, earn stackable credentials, and progress through courses at their own speed. Many institutions adopt a competency-based learning approach where practical, employable skills are taught without excessive and unnecessary coursework, allowing the students to maximize their educational value.\\n\\nIn addition, strategic collaboration with industry giants has also increased the credibility of programs offered online. As corporations have come to recognize the value of investing in their employees' reskilling by paying in advance, these partnerships assist many companies in establishing subsidized tuition. Employers are increasingly funding employee education through affordable tuition fees or sponsoring MBAs, which eases the cost burden on students while meeting industry demands.\\n\\nTo minimize financial barriers, many online MBA programs provide flexible payment schedules, scholarships, and deferred payment plans through income-share agreements. These programs allow new workers to finish a course and start a job without financial strain, as payments can be made in installments after getting hired.\\n\\nHow to evaluate an affordable online MBA?\\n\\nWhen looking for an affordable online MBA program, it is important to understand that low price does not mean low quality. Accreditation is a critical factor as bodies like AMBA, AACSB, or EQUIS also offer global credibility for a high level of recognition. Moreover, well-accredited MBAs ensure that the graduates remain competitive beyond the local job market.\\n\\nReturn on Investment (ROI) is a factor equally important to accreditation. There is no doubt that an MBA program from a reputable institution would offer positive career outcomes like salary increases, fast-tracked career growth, and employment at top-tier corporations. It is crucial that prospective students consider alumni success stories to determine the employability benefits and overall ROI of the program.\\n\\nAnother crucial factor to consider when evaluating an online MBA program is its approach to learning. Quality programs that integrate innovative and non-conventional teaching strategies like case-study methods, simulations, AI personalized learning approaches, and several others, guarantee a vastly superior educational experience and skill outcome.\\n\\nAdditionally, accessibility is also greatly affected by the flexibility of the learning model. Most asynchronous online MBA programs allow students to attend classes at any time, complete assignments at their own pace, and get instructions in person or remotely, which makes it easier for full-time professionals to meet their academic goals without halting their professional growth or compromising personal commitments.\\n\\nNetworking opportunities are another key factor that distinguishes a good online MBA program. While physical campuses, by their nature, help in networking, an online program should offer digital networking opportunities, alumni engagement, mentorship programs, and other avenues for similar industry engagement. These features allow students to expand industry connections and professional reach through a virtual format.\\n\\nUnlike elite business schools that charge premium tuition fees, affordable online MBA programs have unique advantages. These institutions' ability to rapidly adopt new technologies, as well as shifts in business practices, makes them a proactive alternative to more traditional institutions. In addition, these programs appeal to students from many different professional and cultural backgrounds, which enhances collaboration.\\n\\nFinal thoughts\\n\\nThere's no doubt that the online MBA landscape is shifting, and business education is evolving to include skill-based learning and corporate training. With growing emphasis on AI integration, immersive learning experiences, micro-MBA, and specialized executive programs, online MBA programs hold a significant edge over on-site, traditional alternatives. Consequently, we expect the demand for affordable, high-quality online MBA programs to continue to rise. With government policies supporting higher education expansion and technological advancements making digital learning more immersive, the online MBA market is set to grow significantly, with the projected size of India\\u2019s online higher education market expected to reach Rs 85,000 crores by FY 2028, growing at a CAGR of 23.1%.\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"A single-page declassified CIA document has gone viral for its bizarre claim detailing a clash between Soviet soldiers and aliens - an encounter that allegedly ended with 23 Russian troops being turned to stone.\\n\\nThe incident reportedly took place during the Cold War era, around 1989 or 1990, during a military training exercise in Siberia. It came to light after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, when the KGB was dissolved. A 250-page report compiled by the KGB - later acquired by the CIA - recounted the extraordinary events that unfolded after a Soviet military unit allegedly spotted a UFO.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThe document includes numerous photographs, drawings, and eyewitness testimonies from participants in the event. A CIA representative described the case as \\\"a horrific picture of revenge on the part of extraterrestrial creatures, a picture that makes one's blood freeze.\\\"\\n\\nThe report claims, \\\"A quite low-flying spaceship in the shape of a saucer appeared above a military unit that was conducting routine training manoeuvres. For unknown reasons, somebody unexpectedly launched a surface-to-air missile and hit the UFO. It fell to earth not far away, and five short humanoids with large heads and large black eyes emerged from it.\\\"\\n\\nTwo soldiers, who remained alive after freeing themselves from the debris, testified, \\\"The aliens came close together and then merged into a single object that acquired a spherical shape. That object began to buzz and hiss sharply, and then became brilliant white. In a few seconds, the spheres grew much bigger and exploded by flaring up with an extremely bright light.\\\"\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n\\\"At that very instant, 23 soldiers who had watched the phenomenon turned into... stone poles,\\\" recalled the soldiers who survived as they stood in the shade and were less exposed to the luminous explosion.\\n\\nThe KGB report claimed that the 'petrified soldiers' and remains of the UFO were transported to a secret scientific research facility near Moscow. Soviet specialists allegedly concluded that an 'unknown energy source had instantaneously altered the soldiers' biological structure, transforming them into a substance with the same molecular composition as limestone'.\\n\\nThe CIA concluded the report by saying, \\\"If the KGB file corresponds to reality, this is an extremely menacing case. The aliens possess such weapons and technology that go beyond all our assumptions. They can stand up for themselves if attacked.\\\"\\n\\nThe CIA document was declassified in 2000 and was originally covered by Weekly World News in Canada and the Ukrainian newspaper Holos Ukrayiny. The story resurfaced in 2024 when it was featured on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast.\",\n",

In an interview with India Today, he said law enforcement coordination had improved and that both countries were in regular contact over extradition requests, including that of David Coleman Headley, convicted in connection with the 2008 Mumbai attacks.\\n\\nGarcetti also addressed trade issues, noting tensions over tariffs and the need for a bilateral agreement. He said that the two countries must manage differences through direct talks. Garcetti pointed to the importance of shared interests in reducing dependence on China and called for steady engagement to strengthen the Indo-Pacific partnership.\\n\\nMeanwhile, China\\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, responded to the latest tariff hike in the trade dispute with the United States. \\u201cWe are not afraid,\\u201d Xi said in his first public comment on the matter, after Beijing raised tariffs on US goods to 125 percent.\\n\\nThe move followed a US decision under former President Donald Trump to raise tariffs on Chinese goods to 145 percent. China has said it does not plan further increases, calling further escalation ineffective. Watch the full episode to know more.\",\n",

The projection comes with a model error margin of 5%, officials announced on Tuesday.\\n\\nThe southwest monsoon typically begins its advance over Kerala around June 1 and withdraws by mid-September. The projected above-average rainfall could provide a much-needed lift to the agricultural sector, the Ministry of Earth Sciences said.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nAccording to the IMD, this year\\u2019s forecast suggests that most parts of the country are likely to benefit from favourable rainfall conditions, with the exception of a few regions. Rainfall is expected to be below normal in Ladakh, the Northeast, and Tamil Nadu during the four-month monsoon season.\\n\\nThe IMD defines normal rainfall as between 96% and 104% of the 50-year average of 87 cm (about 35 inches). Any amount above this range is considered \\u201cabove normal.\\u201d\\n\\nThe officials said all key climate factors \\u2014 including the El Nino and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) \\u2014 are currently in a neutral phase. These neutral conditions are considered favourable for a healthy monsoon.\\n\\nEl Nino refers to a climate pattern where the surface waters of the central and eastern Pacific Ocean become warmer than usual, often leading to weaker monsoons and less rainfall in India. The Indian Ocean Dipole refers to a weather phenomenon in the Indian Ocean where the difference in sea surface temperatures between the western and eastern parts affects rainfall. A positive IOD usually brings more rain to India, while a negative IOD can reduce it.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nApart from these, another positive indicator this year is the reduced snow cover over Eurasia and the Himalayan region. Historically, lower snow cover in these areas has been associated with stronger monsoon rainfall in India.\\n\\nWith favourable ocean and atmospheric conditions in place, this year\\u2019s monsoon is expected to be above-average and provide much-needed relief to the agricultural sector.\\n\\nPublished By: sharangee Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

India Today accessed a notice sent by Satham to a man named Balaji, accusing him of encroaching on Waqf land registered under survey number 362. According to the notice, Balaji had constructed a house and a shop on the property, which, as per Waqf records, belongs to the mosque.\\n\\nThe notice stated that residents must seek permission, pay ground rent, and comply with Waqf laws\\u2014or face legal eviction.\\n\\nSyed Sadam, who became caretaker of the dargah and mosque following his father's death in 2021, claims the land has belonged to the Waqf Board since 1954 and says they have documents to prove it.\\n\\nAccording to Sadam, his late father lacked formal education and awareness and therefore did not collect rent from those living on the land. Now, Sadam says he intends to rectify this by collecting rent from the residents.\\n\\nHe stated that two more notices will be sent, and if there is no response, the matter will be taken to the High Court.\\n\\nThe residents, however, say they have lived on the land for four generations and consider it their own. They are upset that Sadam is now demanding rent, whereas his father never did.\\n\\nThe issue gained attention when concerned villagers gathered at the District Collector\\u2019s office fearing eviction. Praveen Kumar, Divisional Secretary of the Hindu Munnani, said all 150 families had received similar notices, despite having government-issued documents and paying panchayat taxes. He urged the Collector to grant official land titles (patta) to the villagers, who are anxious about losing their homes and livelihoods.\\n\\nAccording to the residents, the Vellore District Collector has informally advised them not to pay rent for now.\\n\\nThis is the second such Tamil Nadu village that has been claimed by the Waqf law. Previously, a Tiruchendurai village was also sent similar notices saying the land belonged to Waqf board.\\n\\nPublished By: Preeja Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

The move comes as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration as well as an attempt to temper the activism that they perceive as hostile to conservatives.\\n\\nTill now, the US government has cancelled the visas of nearly 530 students, faculty and researchers across 88 colleges and universities, as per a report by CBS.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nIn a letter to the MIT community, university president Sally Kornbluth on Monday expressed concern over the recent government actions that, she said, threatened not just MIT's operations but also the country's ability to attract top global talent and maintain scientific leadership.\\n\\n\\\"Since April 4, nine members of our community - students, recent graduates and postdocs - have had their visas and immigration status unexpectedly revoked,\\\" Kornbluth wrote, adding that the lack of any official communication or rationale from the government was alarming.\\n\\nWhile the institute was not directly involved in the lawsuit filed by one affected student, it says it remained \\\"extremely concerned\\\" about the broader implications.\\n\\n\\\"These actions are interfering with the normal functioning of MIT,\\\" Kornbluth said. \\\"They diminish our ability both to serve the nation and to attract the world's finest talent.\\\"\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThe visa revocations come alongside a separate federal policy shift that prompted MIT and several other top-tier universities, including Princeton, Caltech and the University of Illinois, to sue the Department of Energy (DOE) in a Boston federal court.\\n\\nThe lawsuit challenges the administration's sudden decision to cap indirect research cost reimbursements at 15 per cent, a move that could result in hundreds of millions in lost funding for academic institutions engaged in high-stakes research.\\n\\nIndirect costs cover vital infrastructure and services that support scientific research but aren't tied to a specific project. These include safety protocols, facility maintenance, data storage and compliance systems. MIT noted that nearly 1,000 members of its community rely on DOE grants, which were now at risk.\\n\\nIn her letter, Kornbluth said the cuts would \\\"devastate scientific research at America\\u2019s universities\\\" and hurt the country's long-term innovation prospects.\\n\\n\\\"To find those rare people (with exceptional talent), we open ourselves to talent from every corner of the US and from around the globe,\\\" she wrote. \\\"The threat of unexpected visa revocations will make it less likely that top talent from around the world will come to the US - and that will damage American competitiveness and scientific leadership for years to come.\\\"\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThe Department of Energy announced the new cap on April 11, saying it would make federal research spending more transparent and efficient. But universities say the change is unfair and disruptive, especially since many had already agreed on much higher reimbursement rates. For example, the University of Michigan could lose over USD 30 million because of this new rule.\\n\\nThis is the second time in recent months that universities have been forced into court over similar actions. Earlier this year, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) imposed a similar funding cap, which was then challenged in court. A federal judge issued a permanent injunction halting those cuts while the case proceeds.\\n\\nThe government is using funds to negotiate with the universities and ensure they comply with the directives. The punishment for defiance is freezing of funding, like with Harvard University.\\n\\nThe Trump administration on Monday froze approximately USD 2.3 billion in federal funding to Harvard University after the Ivy League school refused to comply with a list of White House demands to limit activism on campus and dismantle its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes.\\n\\nThe freeze includes USD 2.2 billion in grants and USD 60 million in federal contracts, according to the department's task force on combating antisemitism, which said Harvard's resistance reflected \\\"the troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation's most prestigious universities\\\".\\n\\n(With inputs from Reuters)\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"After days of turmoil triggered by US President Donald Trump\\u2019s tariff strikes, Dalal Street seems to have found its feet again. Indian equities roared back to life on Tuesday, with both the Sensex and Nifty surging over 2%, effectively wiping out all losses incurred since the shock announcement on April 2.\\n\\nTrading resumed after a long weekend, but there was no slowdown in terms of momentum. The Nifty50 climbed as much as 2.4% intraday, comfortably reclaiming its pre-tariff territory, while the Sensex gained over 1,600 points.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nBroader markets mirrored the optimism, with small-cap and mid-cap indices also posting solid gains. Both the main market indices are set to close the trading session on a strong note.\\n\\nWHAT TODAY\\u2019S MARKET RALLY MEANS FOR INVESTORS\\n\\nTuesday\\u2019s bounce wasn\\u2019t just a technical recovery. It was laced with a growing narrative that India, for all its vulnerabilities, is increasingly being viewed as a safe harbour in turbulent global waters.\\n\\n\\\"Indian equities are relatively better positioned right now,\\u201d said Gary Dugan, CEO of The Global CIO Office. \\u201cThere\\u2019s good domestic growth, the market isn\\u2019t as exposed to export shocks, and we are seeing interest shift toward India as a structural China-plus-one play.\\\"\\n\\nThe contrast with China is hard to miss. While Beijing has dug in for a retaliatory fight in response to Washington\\u2019s fresh wave of tariffs, New Delhi has kept its tone diplomatic, quietly working behind the scenes toward a provisional deal.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThat conciliatory stance is paying dividends, at least in the eyes of foreign investors who are beginning to see India as a more stable node in the fractured global supply chain.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the US president\\u2019s latest hint at pausing future tariffs gave the markets exactly the breather they were waiting for. Volatility, which spiked alarmingly in early April, cooled off dramatically, lending further confidence to risk-takers.\\n\\nToday's rally was broad-based and across sectors. Heavyweights such as Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, SBI and Bharti Airtel all surged. Key sectors, including autos, banks, real estate, metals and financials, led from the front.a\\n\\nSTART OF A FRESH BULL RUN?\\n\\nStill, not everyone is rushing to call this the start of a new bull run.\\n\\n\\u201cThe S&P 500 is up 9% from its April lows. Nifty has barely risen 3%. We\\u2019re still playing catch-up,\\u201d said Dr VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services. \\u201cThe short-covering we\\u2019re seeing could fuel further gains, but the uncertainty around Trump\\u2019s trade moves hasn\\u2019t vanished. Sectoral tariffs are likely next, and that could hurt pharmaceuticals in particular.\\u201d\\n\\nHis advice is to stay with stocks rooted in domestic demand. Financials, telecom, hospitality, aviation and healthcare are sectors with earnings visibility and relatively low global exposure.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nMarket watchers agree that the India VIX may have cooled, but it's still hovering 46% above its pre-selloff levels. \\u201cRisk appetite remains fragile,\\u201d said Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit. \\u201cUnless volatility drops meaningfully, pushing past 23,000 on the Nifty may prove difficult. A breakout to 23,400 or even 24,000 needs a big global trigger and calm nerves.\\u201d\\n\\nFor now, the message from the Street is clear. The Dalal Street rally has legs, but it\\u2019s jogging on a tightrope. Investors would do well to resist the urge to chase momentum blindly. Be selective, not aggressive. Stick with quality. The bulls may be back, but so are the risks.\\n\\nPublished By: Koustav Das Published On: Apr 15, 2025\\n\\nTune In\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"After Harvard University rejected the Trump administration's demands to limit campus activism, former US President Barack Obama praised the university for setting an example for other higher education institutions.\\n\\nOn Friday, US President Donald Trump wrote to Harvard demanding the university audit views on diversity on campus and stop recognising certain student clubs. In response, University President Alan Garber wrote in a letter to the Harvard community on Monday, \\\"No government-regardless of which party is in power-should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.\\\"\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nCommending Harvard for defying what he described as the government's \\\"ham-handed\\\" attempt to stifle academic freedom, Obama posted on X, \\\"Harvard has set an example for other higher-ed institutions - rejecting an unlawful and ham-handed attempt to stifle academic freedom, while taking concrete steps to make sure all students at Harvard can benefit from an environment of intellectual inquiry, rigorous debate and mutual respect. Let's hope other institutions follow suit.\\\"\\n\\nJust hours after Harvard's rejection of the demands - which called for broad institutional reforms, changes to admissions policies, or risk losing $9 billion in grants and contracts - the US government announced it would freeze more than $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts to the university.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nColumbia University was the first to be targeted by the Trump administration, ultimately agreeing to the demands under the threat of massive funding cuts. The administration has also paused federal funding for the University of Pennsylvania, Brown, Princeton, Cornell, and Northwestern.\\n\\nTrump's administration has increasingly used the extraordinary tactic of withholding federal funds to pressure academic institutions to align with its political agenda and influence campus policies. The administration has argued that universities allowed antisemitism to go unchecked during last year's campus protests against Israel's war in Gaza.\\n\\nGarber stated that Harvard has already enacted extensive reforms to address antisemitism. He argued that many of the government's demands are unrelated to antisemitism and instead aim to regulate the \\\"intellectual conditions\\\" at the university.\\n\\nGarber said that withholding federal funding from Harvard, one of the nation's top research universities in science and medicine, risks not only the health and well-being of millions of individuals but also the economic security and vitality of our nation. He also claimed the action violates the university's First Amendment rights and exceeds the government's authority under Title VI, which prohibits discrimination based on race, colour, or national origin.\\n\\nAmong the government's demands were requirements that Harvard implement \\\"merit-based\\\" admissions and hiring policies, conduct an audit of students, faculty, and leadership on their views about diversity, and ban face masks on campus-an apparent move against pro-Palestinian protesters.

      "        \"text\": \"Even as Chennai Super Kings fans dream of a comeback from the five-time champions following a rocky start to their IPL 2025 campaign, some worrying visuals have emerged of MS Dhoni limping after his heroics against the Lucknow Super Giants. The CSK captain did not appear to be at his physical best on Monday, April 14, despite delivering an all-round performance that helped end the team's five-match losing streak.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nDhoni showed signs of discomfort even while keeping wickets. After pulling off a magical run-out of Abdul Samad, he was visibly struggling to maintain his balance. Nevertheless, he walked out to bat when Super Kings required more than 10 runs per over in the final five overs of the chase. He went on to smash 26 off just 11 deliveries in a match-winning partnership with Shivam Dube. Dhoni relied heavily on big shots, avoiding quick singles and steering clear of pushing for extra runs between the wickets.\\n\\nLater, he was later seen limping as he descended the stairs of the dressing room for post-match duties. In fact, Dhoni appeared unable to walk freely as he made his way to collect the Player of the Match award - his first such honour in the IPL in seven years.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nIn a more concerning video that has since gone viral on social media, Dhoni was spotted limping again while entering the team hotel in Lucknow on Monday. However, he was not wearing a knee brace or cap when stepping off the team bus.\\n\\nThala Dhoni limping , Hopefully not a serious one pic.twitter.com/cYfPOpWARG\\u2014 Chakri Dhoni (@ChakriDhonii) April 15, 2025\\n\\nWhile it is no secret that Dhoni has been managing a troublesome knee over the past few years, Monday marked the first time this season that he was seen in visible discomfort.\\n\\nHowever, neither MS Dhoni nor the Chennai Super Kings management have expressed any concerns over a potential injury. CSK\\u2019s bowling coach, Eric Simons, did not address the matter when speaking to the press following the team\\u2019s victory in Lucknow.\\n\\nDhoni remained calm and composed on the field after winning the toss and choosing to field against a power-packed Lucknow Super Giants batting line-up. He was sharp behind the stumps and executed a sensational run-out with a direct hit from well behind the wicket, catching the batter short at the non-striker's end. He was also tested by Matheesha Pathirana, who sent down several deliveries straying down the leg side, keeping Dhoni on his toes.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThanks to Dhoni's excellent glovework and a disciplined bowling performance, Super Kings restricted the Super Giants to 166 runs in their allotted 20 overs.\\n\\nDhoni has been managing a wobbly knee throughout his recent IPL stints. During the 2023 season, he led CSK to their fifth IPL title while playing through pain, before undergoing surgery in Mumbai after the tournament.\\n\\nHowever, knee concerns resurfaced in 2024. Despite the recurring issues, Dhoni managed to play all 14 matches for CSK last season.\\n\\nIn a recent podcast, Dhoni said that his future in the IPL would depend on how his body responds at the end of each season.\\n\\nCSK fans will be hoping the veteran wicketkeeper recovers in time and regains full fitness ahead of their high-stakes clash against the Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede Stadium on Sunday, 20 April. The Super Kings have a five-day break before that marquee fixture.\\n\\nPublished By: Akshay Ramesh Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

These students spotted at least nine questionable answers in the JEE Main 2025 April 9 paper.\\n\\nThe errors span all three core subjects: four in physics, three in chemistry, and two in maths. Students say the problems aren\\u2019t just tricky questions -- they are factually incorrect and could seriously affect scores.\\n\\nTop coaching centres and subject experts backed the students\\u2019 claims, saying the problems show poor quality control by NTA for such a major national exam.\\n\\nEducator and commentator @kamath_pramod posted on X, \\u201cIt\\u2019s unacceptable that such basic mistakes are creeping into national-level exams.\\u201d He highlighted one modern physics question from the April 7 AM shift, calling it \\u201cconceptually flawed.\\u201d\\n\\nHe added, \\u201cIf NTA doesn\\u2019t correct this, it\\u2019s an injustice to lakhs of students.\\u201d\\n\\nAnother user on X put it bluntly: \\u201cTragedy of errors \\u2013 JEE Main response sheet is different from what students actually filled in many cases + lot of answers wrongly given by NTA.\\u201d\\n\\nRESPONSE SHEET MESS ADDS TO STUDENTS\\u2019 WORRIES\\n\\nThe issue goes beyond just the answer key. Several candidates and their parents reported major errors in the response sheets shared by NTA. Some students said their selected answers were wrongly recorded, while others found the sheets showing blank responses.\\n\\nPramod Kamath, who is also a parent, posted on social media, \\u201cIndeed my daughter attempted 71 questions. During submission it showed 71 questions attempted & now in the response sheet it is showing all questions as unanswered! Shocking! NTA is playing with the future of children. No response on email!\\u201d\\n\\nAnother student, who appeared for the April 3 shift 2 exam, said he had selected the first option for a physics question, but the response sheet now shows the second option.\\n\\nOne parent, Rekha Verma, wrote on X, \\u201cMy daughter has attempted 50 questions but it is showing 48. So many questions showing the wrong attempt. We will mail to NTA for this blunder. I am very worried for her.\\u201d\\n\\nA different user added, \\u201cActually we are also experiencing similar issue on answer sheet shared by NTA. We request to the management to review and publish error free results.\\u201d\\n\\nA mother whose daughter regularly scored between 180-190 in practice tests said her child\\u2019s answer sheet now shows several incorrect options that were not marked by her.\\n\\n'BLANK' ANSWERS AND UNRESPONSIVE NTA\\n\\nSome students even reported that the system simply didn\\u2019t record their answers at all. One X user shared, \\u201cAnswers submitted were not considered and shows up as \\u2018blank\\u2019. An email to NTA went unanswered. Ridiculous that they conduct an exam for such premier institutes and are least bothered about the transparency. Who will guard the guards?\\u201d\\n\\nIn another post, someone said the same issue occurred with his sister\\u2019s paper -- one question was missing her chosen answer entirely.\\n\\nOPPOSITION LEADERS JOIN IN, QUESTION NTA\\u2019S CREDIBILITY\\n\\nAs reports of errors spread, political leaders also stepped in, questioning the NTA\\u2019s ability to conduct high-stakes exams.\\n\\nReferring to the TOI report, Congress leader Supriya Shrinate posted in Hindi on X:\\n\\n\\u201cThe NTA is already facing questions over the conduct of competitive exams \\u2013 last year's CUET-UG, NEET-UG answer sheets also had errors. Is the NTA capable of conducting these exams? Was the tension of unemployment and paper leaks not enough for our youth that now they have to deal with a weak NTA as well?\\u201d\\n\\nWHAT NEXT FOR STUDENTS?\\n\\nThe window to challenge the JEE Main 2025 Session 2 answer key has already closed, and the results are expected by April 17. But with so many discrepancies raised -- from factual errors to technical glitches -- students are demanding that the NTA drop the flawed questions or award bonus marks.\\n\\nSo far, there\\u2019s been no official response from the agency. With lakhs of students depending on this exam to secure a place in top engineering colleges, the silence is only fuelling anxiety.\\n\\nAll eyes are now on the NTA -- will it admit to the issues and act, or leave students to bear the consequences?\\n\\nPublished By: Roshni Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"title\": \"Like Adolescence, Indian films and shows that mastered one-shot technique\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"There's something about one-shot scenes that brings an inherent excitement, and a sense of unparalleled immersiveness to cinema. A section of the audience couldn't have been more aware of this camera technique until Netflix's 'Adolescence' broke the barriers of storytelling. It was raw, well-coordinated, demanding and so precise that it provided an extra edge to the story. But, this is not the first time that the Indian audience and filmmakers have woken up to this kind of camera movement technique.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nSeveral OTT shows and films have done the same over the years in various scenes to give the audience a taste of something different, something that sets them apart. Have a look at a few here:\\n\\n1. Ship of Theseus (2012): The mother is admitted scene (7 minutes)\\n\\nSohum Shah\\u2019s 'Ship of Theseus' wasn\\u2019t just a philosophical piece, it was also technically brilliant. One of its most powerful scenes, where a mother is admitted to the hospital, plays out in a 7-minute continuous take. The shot captures the chaotic yet intimate emotions of a man navigating bureaucracy, morality, and grief \\u2014 all in one breathless sequence that never cuts away.\\n\\n2. Viduthalai (2023): The train scene (8 minutes)\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nVetri Maaran\\u2019s 'Vidhuthalai' delivers an edge-of-the-seat 8-minute sequence involving a train and a tense, escalating situation. Shot in a single take, the scene is a technical surprise, immersing the audience right into the unfolding drama with no moment to pause or look away. The fluid camera work and the unflinching performances make it one of the most gripping one-take sequences in Indian cinema.\\n\\n3. The Family Man (2019): Hospital assault sequence (13 minutes)\\n\\nShot in a real, functioning hospital with actual heart patients in the ward, this 13-minute one-take sequence is one of 'The Family Man's' most intense moments. Filmed from the villains' perspective, it builds a wave of dread as danger creeps toward unsuspecting characters.\\n\\nInterestingly, despite having just two nights at the expensive location \\u2014 one for rehearsal, and another for shooting - co-director DK refused to break the shot. And the team pulled it off in a single go. It can definitely be seen as a masterclass in coordination, tension, and bold storytelling.\\n\\n4. Gangs of Wasseypur (2012): Home shootout (7 minutes)\\n\\nAnurag Kashyap\\u2019s 'Gangs of Wasseypur' is known for its gritty realism, and one of its standout moments is a seven-minute one-take sequence capturing a frantic shootout. The camera doesn't flinch and follows Faizal Khan's (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) character running through narrow alleys, ducking bullets, and raging through the violence. It's tense, raw, with a slight punch of humour making it deeply cinematic \\u2014 a moment that stays with you long after the film ends.\\n\\n5. Dil Dhadakne Do (2015): The Gallan Goodiyan song (4 minutes)\\n\\nNot all one-take scenes are about action or intensity. Sometimes, it\\u2019s about capturing joy. The 'Gallan Goodiyan' song from 'Dil Dhadakne Do' is a vibrant 4-minute single-shot celebration, following the characters around a cruise ship dinner party as they sing and dance. It\\u2019s also something which can be seen as choreography-triumph, with a spontaneous and infectious sense of pure joy.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n6. CID - The Inheritance (111 minutes)\\n\\nOn November 7, 2004, Sony TV ran a special episode of CID, titled 'The Inheritance', without any single cut. BP Singh, the director of the show, wanted to make an entry into the Guinness Book of World Records and Limca Book of Records, and therefore, he decided to shoot a 111-minute-long episode of the popular show using the one-shot technique, which later went into the pages of history. It didn't just create a record for the longest shot episode, but also for the longest shot to be filmed ever.\\n\\nThe one-shot sequences are demanding. They demand perfection, a solid hold on one's craft, and the best kind of coordination between artistes, cinematographers, directors and the audience. At the end of it all lies audacity, and a spirit to experiment. Indian cinema and the OTT space got to stay on the hustle.\\n\\nPublished By: Vineeta Kumar Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"Union minister Kiren Rijiju defended the recent amendments to the Waqf Act, arguing the changes were necessary to prevent arbitrary land grabs and address long-standing grievances.\\n\\nSpeaking in Kerala on Tuesday, Union Minister Kiren Rijiju said the move was vital to protecting people\\u2019s rights over their land. \\u201cLand is the most precious thing. Many countries go to war for it. We must protect every inch for its rightful owner,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nRijiju criticised the past provisions of the Act for giving \\u201cunprecedented powers\\u201d to Waqf boards, which he alleged had been misused in several cases\\u2014including the Munambam land dispute in Kerala.\\n\\nThe Munambam case, where the Kerala Waqf Board declared 404 acres as Waqf property, allegedly depriving over 600 fishermen of ownership, was a focal point of his address. Rijiju called it a \\u201ctragedy\\u201d and promised justice. \\u201cThe government will ensure such cases do not happen again,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nHe said that as part of the reforms, the Centre has struck down Section 40 of the Act, which had empowered Waqf Boards to unilaterally declare any land as Waqf. \\u201cNo authority should have uncontrolled power. All future surveys will be led by the District Collector and based strictly on government records,\\u201d Rijiju said.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nHe flagged the scale of unchecked claims, stating that over 18 lakh properties were declared as Waqf between 2013 and 2025. \\u201cIf we don\\u2019t act now, people will continue losing ownership. Once declared Waqf, it\\u2019s irreversible\\u2014that cannot continue,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nThe amended law now makes a registered Waqf deed mandatory for any claim. It also bars the declaration of disputed or sub-judice land as Waqf. Another major change is the removal of the \\u201cWaqf by user\\u201d clause, which allowed claims without documentation. \\u201cThat was dangerous,\\u201d Rijiju said.\\n\\nThe Minister also announced that all state Waqf boards and tribunals will be reconstituted. Explaining the legal premise, he said, \\u201cIf a Waqif dedicates a property, then it becomes Waqf\\u2014but it cannot be transferred. That\\u2019s the core of the Munambam issue. It can be challenged.\\u201d\\n\\nTaking aim at the Congress, Rijiju said the 2013 amendments made by the party allowed sweeping Waqf claims. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve now brought in strict safeguards,\\u201d he said. The new law also allows appeals against Waqf Tribunal decisions in High Courts and restructures board and tribunal composition.\\n\\nRijiju said he would visit Munambam later that evening to meet affected residents. Referring to a case involving Mohammad Siddiqui Sait, he said, \\u201cOnce land is transferred, it is no longer Waqf. The High Court ruling can be challenged in the Supreme Court.\\u201d\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nHe urged the Kerala government to act swiftly. \\u201cWe\\u2019re in a federal setup. We\\u2019ve made the law, now the state must implement it. The Centre will provide all legal and administrative support to help people reclaim their land.\\u201d\\n\\nAddressing concerns that the amendments target Muslims, Rijiju said, \\u201cThere\\u2019s a false campaign claiming we\\u2019re anti-Muslim. In fact, crores of poor Muslims have also been denied Waqf benefits. The majority get nothing. This law is not against any community.\\u201d\\n\\nHe also flagged other alleged overreaches. \\u201cIn some instances, Waqf Boards have unilaterally declared entire villages and even Parliament as Waqf property. One person even claimed a third of Delhi. These kinds of unlimited claims will no longer be allowed. Our position is very clear.\\u201d\\n\\nPublished By: Afreen Published On: Apr 15, 2025\\n\\nTune In\",\n",

      "        \"title\": \"Bat sizes under scanner: Why BCCI introduced in-match checks in IPL 2025\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"Before the 2025 IPL season, had you ever seen umpires checking the size of bats out in the middle? Probably not. In a first, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has instructed on-field umpires to carry out regular bat size checks during matches in this season of the premier T20 league.\\n\\nThe practice of assessing bat sizes isn't new. Previously, players would submit their bats for inspection either before a match or on its eve-usually inside the dressing room. Those checks were conducted away from public view.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nIn a bid to step up vigilance, on-field umpires have now been directed to use the 'home-shaped bat gauge' during the game itself. According to The Indian Express, every batter must pass the gauge test before taking guard.\\n\\nDuring the first two weeks of April, several batters-including Hardik Pandya, Phil Salt, and Shimron Hetmyer -- had their bats checked by the umpires on the field. To the BCCI's satisfaction, none of the bats examined exceeded the dimensions outlined in the IPL's official rule book. The regulations specify that the bat's width must not exceed 4.25 inches, and it must pass freely through the gauge.\\n\\n\\\"The blade of the bat must not exceed the following dimensions: Width: 4.25 in / 10.8 cm, Depth: 2.64 in / 6.7 cm, Edge: 1.56 in / 4.0 cm. Moreover, it must be able to pass through a bat gauge,\\\" the rule states.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nWhat prompted this change? Were there any violations?\\n\\n\\\"We always conducted bat checks in the dressing room before the start of the innings. Players would hand over their bats and the check would be completed there,\\\" a former umpire told news agency PTI.\\n\\n\\\"Now the question is: did any player submit one bat for inspection and use a different one on the field? If that's the case, then this new protocol is certainly justified. Players often carry multiple bats. While the weight may vary, the height, width (face of the bat), depth (middle of the blade), and edge width must remain within the ICC's prescribed limits,\\\" the umpire added.\\n\\nAccording to The Indian Express, there have been a few instances where players were found using oversized bats. Those players were let off with warnings, but the BCCI has now opted for stricter enforcement. In today's power-hitting era of T20 cricket, concerns about the bat increasingly overshadowing the ball are growing louder.\\n\\nIPL chairman Arun Dhumal, speaking to the newspaper, said the new checks aim to uphold the spirit of the game.\\n\\nTo put things in perspective, in the first three weeks of IPL 2024, teams posted 10 scores in excess of 200. That number has nearly doubled in 2025, with 19 such totals already recorded. Last season, SunRisers Hyderabad led the big-hitting charge, breaching the 260-run mark three times. They also posted the highest team total in IPL history: 287 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThis year, SRH continued their explosive form, posting 286 in their opening game against Rajasthan Royals-just one run short of their own record.\\n\\nBOWLERS VOICE CONCERNS\\n\\nA number of bowlers, including R Ashwin, Kagiso Rabada, and Shardul Thakur, have raised concerns about the increasing imbalance between bat and ball in IPL 2025. The Impact Player rule, which allows teams to effectively play with an extra batter or bowler, has further tilted the game in favour of the batters.\\n\\n\\\"You say bowlers are becoming defensive. I want to speak about that,\\\" Ashwin said on his YouTube channel. \\\"I think bowlers will soon need personal psychologists. I genuinely mean it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let's say bowlers are becoming defensive-fine. But in several cases, bowling has genuinely become impossible,\\\" he added.\\n\\nIn a move to support bowlers, the BCCI has lifted the ban on the use of saliva to assist with reverse swing. Saliva had been prohibited by the ICC during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nAdditionally, to counter the dew factor, the BCCI has approved the use of a second ball during the second innings of IPL 2025 matches.\\n\\nPublished By: Akshay Ramesh Published On: Apr 15, 2025\\n\\nTune In\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"Robert Vadra, the husband of Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi, labelled the summons by the ED in connection with its money-laundering probe into the Shikhopur land deal a \\\"witch hunt\\\" and \\\"political vendetta\\\". Vadra was questioned for three hours after he marched to the ED office from his residence in Delhi as the federal agency called him for a second time for questioning.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nAfter leaving the ED office, Vadra claimed that whenever he speaks out against the Narendra Modi government and its policies, the Centre begins misusing central agencies. Dismissing the case as a tool for harassment, Vadra told reporters, \\\"There is nothing in the case. For the last twenty years, I have been summoned 15 times and interrogated for more than 10 hours every time. I have submitted 23000 documents.\\\"\\n\\nAhead of the questioning, Vadra said, \\\"It is a political vendetta. Central agencies are being misused by the government.\\\"\\n\\nAlleging that the federal agencies are being misused, Vadra, brother-in-law of Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi, told India Today TV, \\\"They are trying to silence me. They stop Rahul in Parliament...\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Whenever I speak up for people and make them heard, they will try to suppress me... I have always given all the answers and continue to do so,\\\" he added as he was heading to the ED office.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nVadra had skipped the first summons, which was issued on April 8. The central investigating agency is looking into the alleged financial irregularities concerning his firm, Skylight Hospitality.\\n\\nAs per the ED, Vadra's company had purchased a 3.5-acre plot in Gurgaon's Shikophur from Omkareshwar Properties for Rs 7.5 crore back in February 2008.\\n\\nVadra's company, subsequently, sold the parcel of land for Rs 58 crore to real estate giant DLF. Suspecting the proceeds to be part of a laundering scheme, the central agency is probing the money trail behind the windfall gains.\\n\\nOnce Vadra appears for questioning, his statement will be recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).\\n\\nPublished By: sharangee Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has said that visas and immigration statuses for nine of its international students and researchers were revoked without any prior warning or explanation. The move comes as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration as well as an attempt to temper the activism that they perceive as hostile to conservatives.\\n\\nTill now, the US government has cancelled the visas of nearly 530 students, faculty and researchers across 88 colleges and universities, as per a report by CBS.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nIn a letter to the MIT community, university president Sally Kornbluth on Monday expressed concern over the recent government actions that, she said, threatened not just MIT's operations but also the country's ability to attract top global talent and maintain scientific leadership.\\n\\n\\\"Since April 4, nine members of our community - students, recent graduates and postdocs - have had their visas and immigration status unexpectedly revoked,\\\" Kornbluth wrote, adding that the lack of any official communication or rationale from the government was alarming.\\n\\nWhile the institute was not directly involved in the lawsuit filed by one affected student, it says it remained \\\"extremely concerned\\\" about the broader implications.\\n\\n\\\"These actions are interfering with the normal functioning of MIT,\\\" Kornbluth said. \\\"They diminish our ability both to serve the nation and to attract the world's finest talent.\\\"\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThe visa revocations come alongside a separate federal policy shift that prompted MIT and several other top-tier universities, including Princeton, Caltech and the University of Illinois, to sue the Department of Energy (DOE) in a Boston federal court.\\n\\nThe lawsuit challenges the administration's sudden decision to cap indirect research cost reimbursements at 15 per cent, a move that could result in hundreds of millions in lost funding for academic institutions engaged in high-stakes research.\\n\\nIndirect costs cover vital infrastructure and services that support scientific research but aren't tied to a specific project. These include safety protocols, facility maintenance, data storage and compliance systems. MIT noted that nearly 1,000 members of its community rely on DOE grants, which were now at risk.\\n\\nIn her letter, Kornbluth said the cuts would \\\"devastate scientific research at America\\u2019s universities\\\" and hurt the country's long-term innovation prospects.\\n\\n\\\"To find those rare people (with exceptional talent), we open ourselves to talent from every corner of the US and from around the globe,\\\" she wrote. \\\"The threat of unexpected visa revocations will make it less likely that top talent from around the world will come to the US - and that will damage American competitiveness and scientific leadership for years to come.\\\"\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThe Department of Energy announced the new cap on April 11, saying it would make federal research spending more transparent and efficient. But universities say the change is unfair and disruptive, especially since many had already agreed on much higher reimbursement rates. For example, the University of Michigan could lose over USD 30 million because of this new rule.\\n\\nThis is the second time in recent months that universities have been forced into court over similar actions.

      "        \"title\": \"Bat sizes under scanner: Why BCCI introduced in-match checks in IPL 2025\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"Before the 2025 IPL season, had you ever seen umpires checking the size of bats out in the middle? Probably not. In a first, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has instructed on-field umpires to carry out regular bat size checks during matches in this season of the premier T20 league.\\n\\nThe practice of assessing bat sizes isn't new. Previously, players would submit their bats for inspection either before a match or on its eve-usually inside the dressing room. Those checks were conducted away from public view.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nIn a bid to step up vigilance, on-field umpires have now been directed to use the 'home-shaped bat gauge' during the game itself. According to The Indian Express, every batter must pass the gauge test before taking guard.\\n\\nDuring the first two weeks of April, several batters-including Hardik Pandya, Phil Salt, and Shimron Hetmyer -- had their bats checked by the umpires on the field. To the BCCI's satisfaction, none of the bats examined exceeded the dimensions outlined in the IPL's official rule book. The regulations specify that the bat's width must not exceed 4.25 inches, and it must pass freely through the gauge.\\n\\n\\\"The blade of the bat must not exceed the following dimensions: Width: 4.25 in / 10.8 cm, Depth: 2.64 in / 6.7 cm, Edge: 1.56 in / 4.0 cm. Moreover, it must be able to pass through a bat gauge,\\\" the rule states.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nWhat prompted this change? Were there any violations?\\n\\n\\\"We always conducted bat checks in the dressing room before the start of the innings. Players would hand over their bats and the check would be completed there,\\\" a former umpire told news agency PTI.\\n\\n\\\"Now the question is: did any player submit one bat for inspection and use a different one on the field? If that's the case, then this new protocol is certainly justified. Players often carry multiple bats. While the weight may vary, the height, width (face of the bat), depth (middle of the blade), and edge width must remain within the ICC's prescribed limits,\\\" the umpire added.\\n\\nAccording to The Indian Express, there have been a few instances where players were found using oversized bats. Those players were let off with warnings, but the BCCI has now opted for stricter enforcement. In today's power-hitting era of T20 cricket, concerns about the bat increasingly overshadowing the ball are growing louder.\\n\\nIPL chairman Arun Dhumal, speaking to the newspaper, said the new checks aim to uphold the spirit of the game.\\n\\nTo put things in perspective, in the first three weeks of IPL 2024, teams posted 10 scores in excess of 200. That number has nearly doubled in 2025, with 19 such totals already recorded. Last season, SunRisers Hyderabad led the big-hitting charge, breaching the 260-run mark three times. They also posted the highest team total in IPL history: 287 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThis year, SRH continued their explosive form, posting 286 in their opening game against Rajasthan Royals-just one run short of their own record.\\n\\nBOWLERS VOICE CONCERNS\\n\\nA number of bowlers, including R Ashwin, Kagiso Rabada, and Shardul Thakur, have raised concerns about the increasing imbalance between bat and ball in IPL 2025. The Impact Player rule, which allows teams to effectively play with an extra batter or bowler, has further tilted the game in favour of the batters.\\n\\n\\\"You say bowlers are becoming defensive. I want to speak about that,\\\" Ashwin said on his YouTube channel. \\\"I think bowlers will soon need personal psychologists. I genuinely mean it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let's say bowlers are becoming defensive-fine. But in several cases, bowling has genuinely become impossible,\\\" he added.\\n\\nIn a move to support bowlers, the BCCI has lifted the ban on the use of saliva to assist with reverse swing. Saliva had been prohibited by the ICC during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nAdditionally, to counter the dew factor, the BCCI has approved the use of a second ball during the second innings of IPL 2025 matches.\\n\\nPublished By: Akshay Ramesh Published On: Apr 15, 2025\\n\\nTune In\",\n",

Maxwell has a little over 30 runs from five games and has only picked up three wickets this season. For commentator Simon Doull, that seems to be enough. Doull wants Punjab to try out Josh Inglis, who has been warming the benches despite a sensational Champions Trophy. Doull has also suggested that Punjab bring in Azmatullah Omarzai, who has the ability to bowl and bat in the middle phases.\\n\\nPunjab will most certainly miss Lockie Ferguson in the line-up, who has been all but ruled out of the season, and replacing him will be a big task for the team.\\n\\nPBKS vs KKR: Head-to-Head\\n\\nHistorically, KKR lead the rivalry 21-12 in the IPL.

      "        \"text\": \"India is expected to receive above-normal monsoon rainfall in 2025, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasting seasonal rainfall at 105% of the long-period average. The projection comes with a model error margin of 5%, officials announced on Tuesday.\\n\\nThe southwest monsoon typically begins its advance over Kerala around June 1 and withdraws by mid-September. The projected above-average rainfall could provide a much-needed lift to the agricultural sector, the Ministry of Earth Sciences said.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nAccording to the IMD, this year\\u2019s forecast suggests that most parts of the country are likely to benefit from favourable rainfall conditions, with the exception of a few regions. Rainfall is expected to be below normal in Ladakh, the Northeast, and Tamil Nadu during the four-month monsoon season.\\n\\nThe IMD defines normal rainfall as between 96% and 104% of the 50-year average of 87 cm (about 35 inches). Any amount above this range is considered \\u201cabove normal.\\u201d\\n\\nThe officials said all key climate factors \\u2014 including the El Nino and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) \\u2014 are currently in a neutral phase. These neutral conditions are considered favourable for a healthy monsoon.\\n\\nEl Nino refers to a climate pattern where the surface waters of the central and eastern Pacific Ocean become warmer than usual, often leading to weaker monsoons and less rainfall in India. The Indian Ocean Dipole refers to a weather phenomenon in the Indian Ocean where the difference in sea surface temperatures between the western and eastern parts affects rainfall. A positive IOD usually brings more rain to India, while a negative IOD can reduce it.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nApart from these, another positive indicator this year is the reduced snow cover over Eurasia and the Himalayan region. Historically, lower snow cover in these areas has been associated with stronger monsoon rainfall in India.\\n\\nWith favourable ocean and atmospheric conditions in place, this year\\u2019s monsoon is expected to be above-average and provide much-needed relief to the agricultural sector.\\n\\nPublished By: sharangee Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"Even as Chennai Super Kings fans dream of a comeback from the five-time champions following a rocky start to their IPL 2025 campaign, some worrying visuals have emerged of MS Dhoni limping after his heroics against the Lucknow Super Giants. The CSK captain did not appear to be at his physical best on Monday, April 14, despite delivering an all-round performance that helped end the team's five-match losing streak.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nDhoni showed signs of discomfort even while keeping wickets. After pulling off a magical run-out of Abdul Samad, he was visibly struggling to maintain his balance. Nevertheless, he walked out to bat when Super Kings required more than 10 runs per over in the final five overs of the chase. He went on to smash 26 off just 11 deliveries in a match-winning partnership with Shivam Dube. Dhoni relied heavily on big shots, avoiding quick singles and steering clear of pushing for extra runs between the wickets.\\n\\nLater, he was later seen limping as he descended the stairs of the dressing room for post-match duties. In fact, Dhoni appeared unable to walk freely as he made his way to collect the Player of the Match award - his first such honour in the IPL in seven years.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nIn a more concerning video that has since gone viral on social media, Dhoni was spotted limping again while entering the team hotel in Lucknow on Monday. However, he was not wearing a knee brace or cap when stepping off the team bus.\\n\\nThala Dhoni limping , Hopefully not a serious one pic.twitter.com/cYfPOpWARG\\u2014 Chakri Dhoni (@ChakriDhonii) April 15, 2025\\n\\nWhile it is no secret that Dhoni has been managing a troublesome knee over the past few years, Monday marked the first time this season that he was seen in visible discomfort.\\n\\nHowever, neither MS Dhoni nor the Chennai Super Kings management have expressed any concerns over a potential injury. CSK\\u2019s bowling coach, Eric Simons, did not address the matter when speaking to the press following the team\\u2019s victory in Lucknow.\\n\\nDhoni remained calm and composed on the field after winning the toss and choosing to field against a power-packed Lucknow Super Giants batting line-up. He was sharp behind the stumps and executed a sensational run-out with a direct hit from well behind the wicket, catching the batter short at the non-striker's end. He was also tested by Matheesha Pathirana, who sent down several deliveries straying down the leg side, keeping Dhoni on his toes.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThanks to Dhoni's excellent glovework and a disciplined bowling performance, Super Kings restricted the Super Giants to 166 runs in their allotted 20 overs.\\n\\nDhoni has been managing a wobbly knee throughout his recent IPL stints. During the 2023 season, he led CSK to their fifth IPL title while playing through pain, before undergoing surgery in Mumbai after the tournament.\\n\\nHowever, knee concerns resurfaced in 2024. Despite the recurring issues, Dhoni managed to play all 14 matches for CSK last season.\\n\\nIn a recent podcast, Dhoni said that his future in the IPL would depend on how his body responds at the end of each season.\\n\\nCSK fans will be hoping the veteran wicketkeeper recovers in time and regains full fitness ahead of their high-stakes clash against the Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede Stadium on Sunday, 20 April. The Super Kings have a five-day break before that marquee fixture.\\n\\nPublished By: Akshay Ramesh Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"title\": \"Why Mehul Choksi's extradition could be a challenge for India\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"There is renewed hope in India that fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi will be extradited following his arrest in the Belgian city of Antwerp on April 12 on the request of Indian authorities.\\n\\nChoksi, 65, is a key accused in the Rs 13,500 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam, along with nephew Nirav Modi, 54. The case against Modi is that he connived with PNB officials since 2011 to fraudulently raise letters of understanding (LoUs) without the mandatory collaterals and obtained foreign loans, ostensibly for importing pearls and diamonds to make jewellery. However, the money thus raised was used only to retire old debt, ultimately leading to an \\u2018ever-greening\\u2019 of loans.\\n\\n\\n\\nEver since the unravelling of the Nirav Modi scam, Choksi too came under the radar of investigating agencies, including the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Choksi is alleged to owe over Rs 6,000 crore to 34 Indian banks after raising loans in a manner similar to Modi. After the scam came to light in January 2018, Choksi fled to the Caribbean nation of Antigua and Barbuda, where he had taken citizenship.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn May 2021, Choksi surfaced in neighbouring Dominica, where he was detained for illegal entry. A team of CBI officials were flown to Dominica to bring Choksi back, but the move failed as Choksi was allowed by the Dominica High Court in July 2021 to travel back to Antigua to seek medical help.\\n\\n\\n\\nFollowing this, all proceedings against Choksi in Dominica were dropped. Media reports say Choksi had come to Belgium last year for treatment of cancer and had been in that country since.\\n\\n\\n\\nChoksi, who owned Gitanjali Gems, was one of the country\\u2019s most high profile jewellers. At its peak, Gitanjali Gems had 4,000 retail outlets and enjoyed a market share of over 50 per cent of the country\\u2019s organised jewellery market, with prominent brands, including Nakshatra and Gili.\\n\\n\\n\\nIndia and Belgium had a treaty on mutual extradition of fugitive criminals dating back to October 1901, when the former was under British rule. This has gone through several amendments. The two countries signed the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty in 2020 for better cooperation on fugitives.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat India was able to get Choksi arrested in Belgium is a diplomatic win for the government, but it is not clear when he can be extradited to India. This is because the process of extradition is often time consuming, especially since the country of extradition happens to be in Europe.\\n\\n\\n\\nMoreover, the experience with other high-profile fugitives, such as Modi and Vijay Mallya (he left India in 2016), has not been too rosy. Despite several attempts by India, both Mallya and Modi, who are currently based in the UK, have continued to remain out of the dragnet.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat could be a dampener in Choksi\\u2019s extradition from Belgium is the \\u201cdual-criminality\\u201d clause in the extradition treaty. This means a person can be extradited only if his or her offence, including financial bungling, is punishable in both jurisdictions involved, in this case both India and Belgium. That would mean Belgium should consider all charges against Choksi as alleged by India to be punishable under that country\\u2019s law.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere would be a lengthy judicial process involved before the extradition can happen. Moreover, there could be concerns related to human rights since Choksi was arrested in Belgium, where the European Convention on Human Rights applies, say media reports.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ED had been trying to liquidate Choksi\\u2019s assets so that they can pay off the victims of the bank fraud, but the process has been slow. In February 2021, the ED attached assets worth Rs 14.45 crore belonging to the Gitanjali Group and Choksi in relation to the PNB scam.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe attached assets included a 1,460 square feet flat in Mumbai\\u2019s Goregaon, and gold and platinum jewellery, diamond, precious stones, pearl-silver necklaces, watches and a Mercedes Benz car registered in the name of Gitanjali Group and Choksi, the ED said. Earlier, the ED had attached properties worth more than Rs 2,550 crore in the matter.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nSubscribe to India Today Magazine\\n\\nPublished By: Mansi Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"OnePlus has officially confirmed the launch of its next smartphone, the OnePlus 13T, in China on April 24. The company has already begun teasing the phone's design and features, offering a clear early look at what the device will bring to the table. Some of the specifications of the upcoming OnePlus phone have also leaked online. If you haven't been keeping tabs on the OnePlus 13T developments, here are 7 key things we already know about it ahead of the official launch.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nOnePlus 13T launch date announced: 7 things we already know about it\\n\\n-The OnePlus 13T will be available in three colours \\u2014 Morning Mist Gray, Cloud Ink Black, and a special Pink edition. All three shades will feature a low-saturation matte finish, which OnePlus says aligns with its new design approach focused on subtlety and elegance.\\n\\n-OnePlus is seemingly ditching curves in favour of a more squared-off look. The 13T is confirmed to feature a 6.32-inch display with flat sides and rounded corners. This suggests that the 13T will have a compact form factor in comparison to the original OnePlus 13 smartphone.\\n\\n-The phone features what OnePlus calls a \\\"metal cube Deco\\\" \\u2014 a one-piece metallic camera module that gives the back a more unified and refined feel. It marks a departure from previous designs and is intended to match the phone\\u2019s minimal aesthetics, something which the company suggested through its teasers.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n-The iconic Alert Slider is being replaced with a new button that can still toggle between silent, vibration, and ring modes. However, this button can also be customised for different tasks, which is likely to offer more flexibility than its predecessor.\\n\\n-The 13T will come with a dual rear camera setup. While OnePlus hasn\\u2019t detailed the sensors, leaks suggest a 50-megapixel main sensor paired with a 50-megapixel 2x telephoto lens. This combination hints at a focus on balanced performance rather than simply increasing sensor count.\\n\\n-One of the highlights of the 13T is its large battery, confirmed to be more than 6,000mAh. Alongside that, the phone is said to support 80W fast charging tech, which may make it suitable for power users who need reliability without frequent top-ups.\\n\\n-Under the hood, the phone is tipped to run on Qualcomm\\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Elite chipset, which also powered the OnePlus 13 smartphone. This would make it one of the most powerful (and affordable) OnePlus phones yet, paired with a 1.5K 120Hz OLED display that complements its performance with visuals to match.\\n\\nThe OnePlus 13T will be launched in China first, but global rollout details could follow soon after. It is important to note that a few details are based on the leaks and that the company is yet to confirm all the features of the device. But, you can stay tuned to India Today Tech for all the updates.\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"(NOTE: This article was originally published in the India Today issue dated February 15, 1982)\\n\\n\\\"They are cremating Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru for the second time (at National Herald)\\\". Thus wrote septuagenarian M.C. Chalapati Rau, doyen of the \\u2018nationalist press\\u2019 and editor of the Herald for nearly four decades, in a letter addressed to Mrs Gandhi back in 1978.\\n\\nFour years after Rau left that huffy note and resigned, the cremation seemed to be still smouldering. Tottering on the verge of bankruptcy and unable to stem the tide of mismanagement and executive corruption, the Congress(I) high command - which holds controlling shares through a trust - was toying with two alternatives last fortnight: to close down most of its publications, or to sack the present board of directors of the company that publishes the Herald chain, Associated Journals Limited (turnover in 1980-81: Rs 2.5 crore).\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThe Chairman and Managing Director of Associated Journals, Yashpal Kapoor, Mrs Gandhi\\u2019s potbellied Man Friday, recently got a reprieve when the skeletal three-man directors\\u2019 board survived an annual general meeting with most shareholders submissively sending their proxy to Kapoor.\\n\\nBut the company\\u2019s balance sheet, which was surprisingly not circulated at the seemingly well-rehearsed annual general meeting, shows a whopping accumulated loss of Rs 70 lakh against an issued capital base of just Rs 56 lakh. The paper has started skipping editions because newsprint cannot be paid for; payment of wages has become irregular; the journalists, with fingers crossed, are waiting to jump out.\\n\\nTo cap it all, the charmed circle around Rajiv Gandhi has begun a discreet enquiry into the affairs of Associated Journals. Unconfirmed reports hint at Kapoor\\u2019s eventual succession by Arun Nehru, the MP from Uttar Pradesh.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nLiquidity: Talking to INDIA TODAY, Nehru side-stepped the issue of his possible charge by describing it as \\\"pre mature\\\". But he admitted having discussed the \\\"sickness\\u2019 of National Herald and its sister publications with his friend, Rajiv. Many Herald insiders would welcome Nehru for his \\\"high connection\\\" and the board-room experience he earned as managing director of a multinational paints company.\\n\\nHowever, a mere change of guard may not pull the company back from the financial precipice where it has landed itself. In a bid to expand senselessly and far beyond its means, the company has run into what Kapoor himself recognises as the \\\"gravest liquidity problem\\\" in its 44-year history. Samples:\\n\\nThe 496 employees at the New Delhi office were paid their salary for December two weeks after the due date. The chief editor, Hari Jaisingh, got his cheque on January 13.\\n\\nThe nearly 400 employees at the Lucknow office got their salary for October, and that too in instalments, in December.\\n\\nThe Press Trust of India withdrew its tickers from the Herald offices last fortnight after arrears crossed Rs 3 lakh.\\n\\nThe Municipal Corporation of Delhi served final notice on the company last fortnight that the water connection at its offices would be cut because of non-payment of Rs 80,000 of arrear bills.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThe Lucknow edition dropped a day\\u2019s issue in December because it had no cash to buy newsprint. It also can\\u2019t make blocks because the management says it is unable to buy an AC/DC converter worth Rs 3,000.\\n\\nA former employee, sacked six years ago, recently got a High Court decree issued against the company for payment of Rs 17,800 to him as compensation. Since the company said its coffers were empty even office equipment - such as cyclostyling machines - had to be seized and sold last fortnight to pay the ex-employee.\\n\\nA cheque for Rs 50, given to a contributor, bounced recently.\\n\\nThe Herald\\u2019s saga of hard luck does not end here. In 1976, its banker, Punjab National Bank, was compelled by the Emergency regime to sanction a fat loan to the company for the purchase of a Soviet-made rotary machine.\\n\\nThe loan was never paid back, and the bank went to court to obtain a decree of Rs 12 lakh against the company. It was a tricky situation for the guarantor, Vijaya Bank, which paid the money to Punjab National Bank but has little hope of getting back the instalments and interest. Another litigation is inevitable.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nNotorious reputation: The company is notoriously cynical about borrowing and not paying back. A loan of Rs 30 lakh raised by it in 1975-76 for construction of a new building in Lucknow has now become Rs 80 lakh with interest. \\\"We haven\\u2019t been able to pay back a copper of that,\\\" said Kapoor with what looked like an oddly satisfied smile.\\n\\nBehind this shoddy financial profile of the company, and the apparent ineptitude of its managers, lurks a systematic plan to keep it perpetually under the thumb of Mrs Gandhi and her chosen people. The key to it is held by Jan Hit Nidhi Trust, formed by Jawaharlal Nehru\\u2019s associates - P.N. Sapru, Umashankar Dixit and Padmaja Naidu - in the late \\u201850s, which holds Rs 40 lakh of the Associated Journals\\u2019 Rs 56 lakh of issued capital.\\n\\nIts three present trustees are: P.A. Narielwala, former Tata employee, Congressman, and secretary to the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund; Umashankar Dixit, a former Union home minister and Congress(I) veteran; and, Bishambhar Nath Pandey, president of the Uttar Pradesh Congress(I) Committee. Apparently, all three of them repose their trust firmly in Mrs Gandhi.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nIn 1978, when Mrs Gandhi broke away to form her own party, the trustees took shelter behind a clause in the company\\u2019s 1938 article of association which said \\\"the policies of the newspapers published by the company will be to support and propagate the policies of the Indian National Congress\\\". The trustees - predictably - resolved that Mrs Gandhi\\u2019s party alone was the true Congress.\\n\\nIndividual shareholders: Besides the Trust, the company\\u2019s shares are held by about 300 individuals, only five of whom own shares worth more than Rs 1 lakh. Mrs Gandhi herself owns just Rs 1,000-worth of shares, for which she sent her proxy to Kapoor at the last annual general meeting.\\n\\nThe paper, which had a glorious record during the freedom movement, came up in the wake of the first popular ministry in Uttar Pradesh in 1937. Nehru and Rafi Ahmed Kidwai took the initiative, and funds poured in from all corners of the country. But subsequent leaders of the Herald deftly kept the original donors out of the picture.\\n\\nThe Tatas, for example, donated a sum of Rs 3 lakh which was in preference shares and was never converted into equities, thus denying the family reputed for its professional ability any say at the shareholders\\u2019 meetings.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nKapoor was chosen by Mrs Gandhi in 1978 when the previous managing director, Mohammed Yunus, resigned after submitting a strongly-worded report favouring closure of the Delhi edition of the paper. Yunus\\u2019 decision was born out of pragmatism: the Delhi edition sold just about 1,000 copies at that time compared with 5,000 for the Lucknow edition.\\n\\nBut Mrs Gandhi, pitted against generally hostile media, needed the Herald to continue in the capital, and Kapoor obliged her by continuing to roll out the Delhi edition, throwing overboard all financial considerations.\\n\\nUntraceable accounts: During the Emergency the company raked in enormous funds through questionable advertisement collections and doubtful and often unaccounted donations. An enquiry by the Company Law Board, the report of which was hushed up soon after the Congress(I)\\u2019s return to power, established that sources of an amount of Rs 4.87 crore, shown in the book of accounts, were \\\"untraceable\\\".\\n\\nHowever, after Mrs Gandhi\\u2019s defeat in 1977, sources of finance ran dry. Kapoor had to fall back on the age-old escape route from financial distress: robbing employees.\\n\\nHis management stopped transmitting employees\\u2019 insurance premiums; provident fund and health insurance dues were deducted from employees\\u2019 salary but not paid to the relevant departments; income tax deducted at source was not deposited; auditors checking the company\\u2019s balance sheets were aghast to find that there was no system of internal auditing.\\n\\nThis was topped with a paralysing lock-out in all offices of the Herald from March 1979 till the next year. The paper limped back to normalcy only after Mrs Gandhi came back to power in 1980.\\n\\nMeanwhile, journalists and other staff left the paper in droves, some in disgust, others out of sheer necessity. Even Khushwant Singh, who had a brief stint as the chief editor, faltered in his determination to improve Mrs Gandhi\\u2019s image when he was unable to make the management pay the staff their salary every month.\\n\\nPromises: Kapoor brought in Hari Jaisingh, a nondescript resident editor of the Ahmedabad edition of Indian Express, as the chief editor. With the happy tiding of 1980 came promises of more donations, more advertisements, more forced sales.\\n\\nKapoor reconstituted the board of directors, its two other members being Vimal Malhotra, a small-time industrialist who, as a trade union leader, had once headed the National Herald employees\\u2019 union, and Mallikarjun, deputy minister for Railways, who held the post in total violation of the convention that no minister should hold a director\\u2019s office.\\n\\nIn the name of expansion, the board opened up a chapter of unprecedented squander-mania. Three editions of the Herald\\u2019s sister Urdu publication, Quaumi Awaz, were started from Delhi, Bombay and Patna, apart from its usual Lucknow edition.\\n\\nA parallel unit was begun from New Delhi\\u2019s Indian and Eastern Newspapers Society (IENS) building to bring out English and Hindi editions of a little-known publication called Indian Farmers\\u2019 Journal. The other plans on the card include three new editions of Herald, and its Hindi co-publication, Navjivan (now brought out from Lucknow alone), from Bombay, Hyderabad and Bhopal.\\n\\nIn the process, however, the company\\u2019s real interest was diverted from newspapering to construction. Next to its present office at Kaiserbagh on the banks of the Gomti in Lucknow, it began a 12-storeyed building for Rs 4 crore; at Bhopal, it concluded a controversial land deal with the Bhopal Development Authority to start construction of yet another building for Rs 2 crore.\\n\\nVarious queries: From where did the promise of new capital come? And - as many in Herald are asking now - if money was at all available, why wasn\\u2019t it used to clear the debts to banks, the Government and the employees? However, Kapoor is not amused.\\n\\nRecently, he stopped deduction of provident fund for all employees drawing over Rs 1,600 a month on the plea that the Provident Fund Act allows him to do so - a contention not corroborated so far by the Fund authorities. Thus, he has escaped statutory obligations in every way on the plea of economy, but has still managed to go ahead with his grandiose \\u2018expansion plans\\u2019.\\n\\nLast fortnight, Kapoor, talking to INDIA TODAY, admitted that the buildings were to be financed by a \\\"group of businessmen\\\" who would \\\"not charge Herald a rupee\\\". But he was silent on:\\n\\n-Whether this transaction would be shown in the company\\u2019s books of account and, if so, how;\\n\\n-Why the concerned businessmen offered to make contributions; and,\\n\\n-How business in real estate was consistent with National Herald\\u2019s memorandum of association.\\n\\nBrushing these issues aside, Kapoor said: \\\"The main task is to make Associated Journals Limited immune to the Congress Party\\u2019s vicissitudes of fortune. We were victims of a systematic witch-hunt during the Janata period, when our advertisement earnings were forcibly lowered, our workers were instigated to go on strike, and the paper was dragged into a tangle of false litigations. The buildings will allow us relative independence even when the Congress is out of power. We want to be free from financial worries for all time to come.\\\"\\n\\nBoth Kapoor and Jaisingh claim to have gone a long way in \\u2018professionalising\\u2019 the organisation. \\\"We\\u2019ve been objective in our reporting and fair in our editorial views, within certain parameters, of course.\\\" defensively argues a mild-mannered Jaisingh. \\\"We even print Opposition news.\\\" piped in Kapoor more bluntly.\\n\\nHowever, as a senior journalist in the paper remarked, \\\"Herald projects only two leaders, if you may say so: Mrs Gandhi and Yashpal Kapoor.\\\" In 1981, Kapoor\\u2019s statements and photographs were front-paged over 50 times in the paper, variously describing him as \\\"senior Congress leader\\\", \\\"prominent leader of the Indian National Trade Union Congress\\\", and \\\"leading social worker\\\".\\n\\nQuipped the journalist, \\\"For the readers of the Herald - not a large community, I dare say - the race between the prime minister and Kapoor is quite a photo finish, with Rajiv Gandhi coming in as a distant third.\\\"\\n\\nToeing the line: On reporting political issues, the paper often toes the Congress(I) line in quite a brazen-faced manner. On the eve of the Opposition-sponsored Bharat Bandh on January 19, its two main front-page headlines read: \\\"Government to be tough on coercing strikers\\\" and \\\"More to ignore bandh\\\".\\n\\nWhen the Maharashtra chief minister, A.R. Antulay lost his case at Bombay High Court and resigned, the editorial in National Herald merely sang paeans of praise to Mrs Gandhi for being \\\"democratic\\\" in accepting Antulay\\u2019s resignation.\\n\\nHowever, its closeness to the Congress(I) gives it occasional flashes of insight: it was the only daily to predict the latest round of reshuffles in the Union Cabinet on the morning it took place.\\n\\nIt is true that there have been confusing trends once in a while; like the Herald suddenly publishing an article by T.N. Kaul criticising the recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan. But insiders promptly put it down to \\\"editorial ignorance\\\" of which way the wind was blowing.\\n\\nA front-page article criticising the Congress(I) chief ministers\\u2019 frequent trips to Delhi was explained by them as a subtle attempt to \\\"wangle\\\" state government advertisements.\\n\\nHowever, to ask the Herald authorities about its circulation - like asking a woman her age - is considered impolite. Though Jaisingh claims a weekday circulation of 20,000-plus in the capital and 30,000-plus in Lucknow, a representative of the National Herald Employees\\u2019 Union averred that the combined daily sale was \\\"within 15,000\\\".\\n\\nOn such a slender circulation base, how the paper brings out 10 to 12 supplements - loaded with ads - in a month is a mystery in the newspaper circle. In 1980-81, it netted Rs 1.25 crore from advertisements. As Kapoor fondly mused, \\\"Our ad and circulation boys are simply brilliant.\\\"\\n\\nThat again is a mystery. Last year, both the circulation and advertisement managers of the company quit their posts. The new circulation manager, who was catapulted to the office, was once a timekeeper in the Lucknow office, while the new advertisement manager was a clerk in the advertisement department.\\n\\nIn fact, examples of such spectacular rises are legion at National Herald: a sub-editor overnight finds himself in the chair of a leader writer, a junior sports sub is suddenly anointed as the sports editor, a line operator takes over as the chief press supervisor.\\n\\nChalapati Rau, who had once in disgust burnt copies of the paper at the site of Nehru\\u2019s cremation at Shantivana, remarked: \\\"The National Herald\\u2019s only editorial policy is to sing bhajans to Indira Gandhi and Yashpal Kapoor; its only business policy is to plunder resources and to secure ads by blackmail.\\\"\\n\\nFirmness: Rau has a right to vituperate. During the Emergency, when he was the chief editor, he did not allow any statement or photograph of Sanjay Gandhi, then all-powerful in the Congress, to appear in the paper. He refused to draw a salary of more than Rs 2,000 a month (Jaisingh gets Rs 8,000, including perks).\\n\\nEven Mrs Gandhi used to fear the sharpness of his tongue and the acid in his pen. In 1978, he was thrown out of office, and, since then, Kapoor has taken care to see that his Rs 1,500 monthly pension is stopped.\\n\\nEven a member of the Jan Hit Nidhi Trust, who refused to be identified, agrees that the paper has little viability unless \\\"we choose between two alternatives: to run it as a purely professional organisation, or to run it as a completely above-board party organ, free from wheeler-dealers\\u2019 interference\\\".\\n\\nHe cited the example of Hindustan Times, which started as a mouthpiece of the Gadr Party but later on became a commercial organisation under the Birlas, and survived. At the other end of the gamut, the two communist parties, he said, have been able to continue with their respective party organs without undue reliance on advertising revenue.\\n\\nBut the Herald, with its 900 staff, and its management\\u2019s all-consuming desire to turn it into a money-spinner, cannot but choose a half-way house from where it has to increasingly lean on non-newspaper profits: in 1980-81, it earned Rs 20 lakh by renting out its premises in Delhi.\\n\\n\\\"No newspaper\\\", said the sceptic trustee, \\\"has ever been profitable by propagating the views of one political party.\\\" Evidently not impressed by this line of argument, Kapoor counterposed, \\\"If the Congress can be a viable party, why can\\u2019t National Herald be a viable paper?\\\" No wonder that the current joke at the Herald office is to whisper aloud: \\\"We want Antulay\\\".\\n\\nSubscribe to India Today Magazine\\n\\nPublished By: Mansi Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"The second season of The Last of Us introduces new characters and a mysterious figure named Eugene, whose death stirs curiosity. Though never seen alive in the series, Eugene\\u2019s story, tied to Joel\\u2019s actions, leaves fans eager for answers. Here\\u2019s everything known about him from the HBO series and the games it\\u2019s based on.\\n\\n\\n\\n[SPOILERS AHEAD]\\n\\n\\n\\nHow is Eugene portrayed in The Last of Us game?\\n\\n\\n\\nIn The Last of Us Season two, Eugene is a background presence, never met but often mentioned by Ellie and Dina. They describe him as a funny, sharp man skilled with electronics, teaching Dina her technical know-how. A weed enthusiast, he left a lasting impression, but his life was troubled.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a Firefly resistance member, he was often away from his wife and child. Players find a note from his wife in an abandoned library outpost, pleading for his return. Dina shares darker tales, saying Eugene and Tommy committed terrorist acts, including an attack on FEDRA forces in Denver that killed three soldiers and two civilians. She also recalls the \\u201cslow-torturing\\u201d a FEDRA general, noting, \\u201cThey got into some real dark s**t.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\nEllie and Dina say Eugene died at 73 from a stroke, likely without reuniting with his family.\\n\\n\\n\\nWho was Eugene?\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the HBO series, Eugene is introduced through Gail, Joel\\u2019s therapist, played by Catherine O\\u2019Hara. Like in the games, he grew marijuana, with Gail saying, \\u201cthe man would grow buds the size of pinecones \\u2014 sticky as glue.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\nUnlike the games, Gail was his wife, and Joel killed him. She confronts Joel, stating, \\u201cYou shot and killed my husband. You killed Eugene, and I resent you for it. No, maybe a little more than that. I hate you for it. And yes, I know you had no choice. I know that. I know I should forgive you. But I tried, and I can\\u2019t. Because of how you did it.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\nGail marks her \\u201cfirst birthday without my husband in 41 years,\\u201d suggesting a recent death. Her comment that Joel had \\u201cno choice\\u201d hints Eugene was infected, but her anger suggests complexity. As per the Entertainment Weekly report, a flashback episode featuring Joe Pantoliano as Eugene will reveal more.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy did Joel kill Eugene?\\n\\n\\n\\nThe reason remains unclear. Gail\\u2019s belief that Joel had \\u201cno choice\\u201d points to Eugene being infected, but her deep resentment implies there\\u2019s more to the story.\\n\\n\\n\\nO\\u2019Hara told Entertainment Weekly, \\u201cI\\u2019ve never had to cry so much for so many takes,\\u201d about filming the flashback, calling it \\u201ckiller.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\nCo-creator Neil Druckmann told Variety, \\u201cThe story we told [in the game] was somewhat superficial. The way this character comes in really gets to the heart of Joel and Ellie and their relationship.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere and When to Watch The Last of Us?\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Last of Us Season two is currently streaming on Max, with season 2 episodes airing Sundays at 9 pm ET/PT and 8 pm CT. According to the Entertainment Weekly report, Eugene\\u2019s story adds depth to the series. His death, distinct from the game\\u2019s stroke to Joel\\u2019s actions in the show, sets up a pivotal moment that will explore Joel and Ellie\\u2019s bond, keeping viewers hooked.\\n\\nPublished By: Aashish Vashistha Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"title\": \"Like Adolescence, Indian films and shows that mastered one-shot technique\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"There's something about one-shot scenes that brings an inherent excitement, and a sense of unparalleled immersiveness to cinema. A section of the audience couldn't have been more aware of this camera technique until Netflix's 'Adolescence' broke the barriers of storytelling. It was raw, well-coordinated, demanding and so precise that it provided an extra edge to the story. But, this is not the first time that the Indian audience and filmmakers have woken up to this kind of camera movement technique.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nSeveral OTT shows and films have done the same over the years in various scenes to give the audience a taste of something different, something that sets them apart. Have a look at a few here:\\n\\n1. Ship of Theseus (2012): The mother is admitted scene (7 minutes)\\n\\nSohum Shah\\u2019s 'Ship of Theseus' wasn\\u2019t just a philosophical piece, it was also technically brilliant. One of its most powerful scenes, where a mother is admitted to the hospital, plays out in a 7-minute continuous take. The shot captures the chaotic yet intimate emotions of a man navigating bureaucracy, morality, and grief \\u2014 all in one breathless sequence that never cuts away.\\n\\n2. Viduthalai (2023): The train scene (8 minutes)\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nVetri Maaran\\u2019s 'Vidhuthalai' delivers an edge-of-the-seat 8-minute sequence involving a train and a tense, escalating situation. Shot in a single take, the scene is a technical surprise, immersing the audience right into the unfolding drama with no moment to pause or look away. The fluid camera work and the unflinching performances make it one of the most gripping one-take sequences in Indian cinema.\\n\\n3. The Family Man (2019): Hospital assault sequence (13 minutes)\\n\\nShot in a real, functioning hospital with actual heart patients in the ward, this 13-minute one-take sequence is one of 'The Family Man's' most intense moments. Filmed from the villains' perspective, it builds a wave of dread as danger creeps toward unsuspecting characters.\\n\\nInterestingly, despite having just two nights at the expensive location \\u2014 one for rehearsal, and another for shooting - co-director DK refused to break the shot. And the team pulled it off in a single go. It can definitely be seen as a masterclass in coordination, tension, and bold storytelling.\\n\\n4. Gangs of Wasseypur (2012): Home shootout (7 minutes)\\n\\nAnurag Kashyap\\u2019s 'Gangs of Wasseypur' is known for its gritty realism, and one of its standout moments is a seven-minute one-take sequence capturing a frantic shootout. The camera doesn't flinch and follows Faizal Khan's (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) character running through narrow alleys, ducking bullets, and raging through the violence. It's tense, raw, with a slight punch of humour making it deeply cinematic \\u2014 a moment that stays with you long after the film ends.\\n\\n5. Dil Dhadakne Do (2015): The Gallan Goodiyan song (4 minutes)\\n\\nNot all one-take scenes are about action or intensity. Sometimes, it\\u2019s about capturing joy. The 'Gallan Goodiyan' song from 'Dil Dhadakne Do' is a vibrant 4-minute single-shot celebration, following the characters around a cruise ship dinner party as they sing and dance. It\\u2019s also something which can be seen as choreography-triumph, with a spontaneous and infectious sense of pure joy.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n6. CID - The Inheritance (111 minutes)\\n\\nOn November 7, 2004, Sony TV ran a special episode of CID, titled 'The Inheritance', without any single cut. BP Singh, the director of the show, wanted to make an entry into the Guinness Book of World Records and Limca Book of Records, and therefore, he decided to shoot a 111-minute-long episode of the popular show using the one-shot technique, which later went into the pages of history. It didn't just create a record for the longest shot episode, but also for the longest shot to be filmed ever.\\n\\nThe one-shot sequences are demanding. They demand perfection, a solid hold on one's craft, and the best kind of coordination between artistes, cinematographers, directors and the audience. At the end of it all lies audacity, and a spirit to experiment. Indian cinema and the OTT space got to stay on the hustle.\\n\\nPublished By: Vineeta Kumar Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

The operating cabin crew offered to assist the guest, including deplaning by using the 'ambulift' assigned to the aircraft as per SOP, but the delay\\u2014not denial\\u2014in providing wheelchair assistance was due to unusually high demand for wheelchairs and staff at that time.

The mother of the minor victim has also approached the top court challenging the High Court's order.\\n\\nThe Allahabad High Court also faced flak for another ruling where it granted bail to a person accused of raping a woman in Delhi, saying that the survivor \\\"herself invited trouble\\\" and bore responsibility for the incident.\\n\\nJustice Sanjay Kumar Singh of the High Court said the survivor, being a postgraduate student, was mature and competent enough to understand \\\"the morality and significance of her actions\\\".\\n\\nPublished By: sharangee Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"The country's largest electric car manufacturer, Tata Motors, is targeting a real-world range of around 500km on a single full charge for the upcoming Harrier.ev, according to Tata Passenger Electric Mobility's Chief Commercial Officer Vivek Srivatsa.\\n\\nTata Passenger Electric Mobility or Tata.ev is a subsidiary of Tata Motors for the electric vehicle (EV) business.\\n\\nAt present, the company offers electric cars like the Tiago.ev, Tigor.ev, Punch.ev, Nexon.ev and Curvv.ev. It will introduce the Harrier.ev and the Sierra.ev in FY26.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n\\\"As the leader of the Indian EV market, we are committed to a portfolio of innovative and compelling EVs that resonate with the diverse use cases of discerning customers. We recently showcased the Harrier.ev at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo 2025, with its launch planned in FY26,\\\" Srivatsa told India Today.\\n\\nThe Harrier.ev is based on Tata's pure EV architecture -- acti.ev+. The electric SUV will have a quad-wheel-drive (QWD) dual motor setup, delivering 500Nm of peak torque. \\\"We are targeting a real-world range of around 500km, addressing range anxiety,\\\" Srivatsa said.\\n\\nThe real-world range for EVs is usually lower than the range certified by Modified Indian Drive Cycle. Among the Tata EVs, the Curvv.ev has the highest real-world range of up to 425km on a single full charge, followed by the Nexon.ev of up to 375km.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nAccording to data from the industry body Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA), Tata's electric car sales fell 10.71% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 57,616 units in FY25 from 64,530 units in FY24. Moreover, the segment share dropped to 53.52% in FY25 from 70.52% in FY24.\\n\\nThe arrival of rival original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) like Mahindra and JSW MG Motor India with new models in the electric car space is among the reasons for Tata's share taking a hit.\\n\\nWhen asked about the decline in Tata's share, Srivatsa said: \\\"With more players, the share will certainly even itself out, but we know we will continue to lead the category, leveraging our deep understanding of the Indian consumer and their nuances.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Temporary challenges do not deter us, as the largest four-wheeler manufacturer in this space, we offer the widest range of EVs, priced between Rs 8 lakh and Rs 22 lakh across a variety of body styles and battery pack options. This is a portfolio tailor-made to the Indian customers' preference and use case, unlike other products in the market, which are derivatives of offerings tailored to global markets, with very little Indian context,\\\" he observed.\\n\\nHaving started with the Nexon.ev in 2020, Tata has sold over 2,00,000 units of electric cars till now. The company manufactures EVs across its Pune, Ranjangaon and Sanand facilities.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nEarlier this year, Tata introduced the Open Collaboration 2.0 framework to enhance India's EV charging ecosystem. It aims to more than double the number of charging points to 4,00,000 by 2027 in partnership with charge point operators (CPOs) and oil marketing companies (OMCs).\\n\\n\\\"India's charging infrastructure is more of a chicken and egg story, with increasing EV adoption, charging points too will increase. Private CPOs are imperative in setting up a charging infrastructure that works for the benefit of the customer. Critically, it is the private players who are laying the groundwork for a sustainable, EV-centric future,\\\" Srivatsa said.\\n\\nSubscribe to Auto Today Magazine\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"Just days after the NEET UG controversy, the National Testing Agency (NTA) is once again facing sharp criticism -- this time over factual mistakes and technical issues in the JEE Main 2025 Session 2 exam.\\n\\nStudents, parents, and educators are up in arms after the release of the provisional answer key and response sheets on April 11.\\n\\nCOACHING HUB KOTA FLAGS MULTIPLE ERRORS\\n\\nThe latest storm was kicked off by students from Kota, Rajasthan -- India\\u2019s biggest coaching hub for engineering aspirants, as per a Times of India report. These students spotted at least nine questionable answers in the JEE Main 2025 April 9 paper.\\n\\nThe errors span all three core subjects: four in physics, three in chemistry, and two in maths. Students say the problems aren\\u2019t just tricky questions -- they are factually incorrect and could seriously affect scores.\\n\\nTop coaching centres and subject experts backed the students\\u2019 claims, saying the problems show poor quality control by NTA for such a major national exam.\\n\\nEducator and commentator @kamath_pramod posted on X, \\u201cIt\\u2019s unacceptable that such basic mistakes are creeping into national-level exams.\\u201d He highlighted one modern physics question from the April 7 AM shift, calling it \\u201cconceptually flawed.\\u201d\\n\\nHe added, \\u201cIf NTA doesn\\u2019t correct this, it\\u2019s an injustice to lakhs of students.\\u201d\\n\\nAnother user on X put it bluntly: \\u201cTragedy of errors \\u2013 JEE Main response sheet is different from what students actually filled in many cases + lot of answers wrongly given by NTA.\\u201d\\n\\nRESPONSE SHEET MESS ADDS TO STUDENTS\\u2019 WORRIES\\n\\nThe issue goes beyond just the answer key. Several candidates and their parents reported major errors in the response sheets shared by NTA. Some students said their selected answers were wrongly recorded, while others found the sheets showing blank responses.\\n\\nPramod Kamath, who is also a parent, posted on social media, \\u201cIndeed my daughter attempted 71 questions. During submission it showed 71 questions attempted & now in the response sheet it is showing all questions as unanswered! Shocking! NTA is playing with the future of children. No response on email!\\u201d\\n\\nAnother student, who appeared for the April 3 shift 2 exam, said he had selected the first option for a physics question, but the response sheet now shows the second option.\\n\\nOne parent, Rekha Verma, wrote on X, \\u201cMy daughter has attempted 50 questions but it is showing 48. So many questions showing the wrong attempt. We will mail to NTA for this blunder. I am very worried for her.\\u201d\\n\\nA different user added, \\u201cActually we are also experiencing similar issue on answer sheet shared by NTA. We request to the management to review and publish error free results.\\u201d\\n\\nA mother whose daughter regularly scored between 180-190 in practice tests said her child\\u2019s answer sheet now shows several incorrect options that were not marked by her.\\n\\n'BLANK' ANSWERS AND UNRESPONSIVE NTA\\n\\nSome students even reported that the system simply didn\\u2019t record their answers at all. One X user shared, \\u201cAnswers submitted were not considered and shows up as \\u2018blank\\u2019. An email to NTA went unanswered. Ridiculous that they conduct an exam for such premier institutes and are least bothered about the transparency. Who will guard the guards?\\u201d\\n\\nIn another post, someone said the same issue occurred with his sister\\u2019s paper -- one question was missing her chosen answer entirely.\\n\\nOPPOSITION LEADERS JOIN IN, QUESTION NTA\\u2019S CREDIBILITY\\n\\nAs reports of errors spread, political leaders also stepped in, questioning the NTA\\u2019s ability to conduct high-stakes exams.\\n\\nReferring to the TOI report, Congress leader Supriya Shrinate posted in Hindi on X:\\n\\n\\u201cThe NTA is already facing questions over the conduct of competitive exams \\u2013 last year's CUET-UG, NEET-UG answer sheets also had errors. Is the NTA capable of conducting these exams? Was the tension of unemployment and paper leaks not enough for our youth that now they have to deal with a weak NTA as well?\\u201d\\n\\nWHAT NEXT FOR STUDENTS?\\n\\nThe window to challenge the JEE Main 2025 Session 2 answer key has already closed, and the results are expected by April 17. But with so many discrepancies raised -- from factual errors to technical glitches -- students are demanding that the NTA drop the flawed questions or award bonus marks.\\n\\nSo far, there\\u2019s been no official response from the agency. With lakhs of students depending on this exam to secure a place in top engineering colleges, the silence is only fuelling anxiety.\\n\\nAll eyes are now on the NTA -- will it admit to the issues and act, or leave students to bear the consequences?\\n\\nPublished By: Roshni Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"title\": \"Union Minister says new Waqf Act will not let Munambam-like issue to happen\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"Union minister Kiren Rijiju defended the recent amendments to the Waqf Act, arguing the changes were necessary to prevent arbitrary land grabs and address long-standing grievances.\\n\\nSpeaking in Kerala on Tuesday, Union Minister Kiren Rijiju said the move was vital to protecting people\\u2019s rights over their land. \\u201cLand is the most precious thing. Many countries go to war for it. We must protect every inch for its rightful owner,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nRijiju criticised the past provisions of the Act for giving \\u201cunprecedented powers\\u201d to Waqf boards, which he alleged had been misused in several cases\\u2014including the Munambam land dispute in Kerala.\\n\\nThe Munambam case, where the Kerala Waqf Board declared 404 acres as Waqf property, allegedly depriving over 600 fishermen of ownership, was a focal point of his address. Rijiju called it a \\u201ctragedy\\u201d and promised justice. \\u201cThe government will ensure such cases do not happen again,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nHe said that as part of the reforms, the Centre has struck down Section 40 of the Act, which had empowered Waqf Boards to unilaterally declare any land as Waqf. \\u201cNo authority should have uncontrolled power. All future surveys will be led by the District Collector and based strictly on government records,\\u201d Rijiju said.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nHe flagged the scale of unchecked claims, stating that over 18 lakh properties were declared as Waqf between 2013 and 2025. \\u201cIf we don\\u2019t act now, people will continue losing ownership. Once declared Waqf, it\\u2019s irreversible\\u2014that cannot continue,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nThe amended law now makes a registered Waqf deed mandatory for any claim. It also bars the declaration of disputed or sub-judice land as Waqf. Another major change is the removal of the \\u201cWaqf by user\\u201d clause, which allowed claims without documentation. \\u201cThat was dangerous,\\u201d Rijiju said.\\n\\nThe Minister also announced that all state Waqf boards and tribunals will be reconstituted. Explaining the legal premise, he said, \\u201cIf a Waqif dedicates a property, then it becomes Waqf\\u2014but it cannot be transferred. That\\u2019s the core of the Munambam issue. It can be challenged.\\u201d\\n\\nTaking aim at the Congress, Rijiju said the 2013 amendments made by the party allowed sweeping Waqf claims. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve now brought in strict safeguards,\\u201d he said. The new law also allows appeals against Waqf Tribunal decisions in High Courts and restructures board and tribunal composition.\\n\\nRijiju said he would visit Munambam later that evening to meet affected residents. Referring to a case involving Mohammad Siddiqui Sait, he said, \\u201cOnce land is transferred, it is no longer Waqf. The High Court ruling can be challenged in the Supreme Court.\\u201d\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nHe urged the Kerala government to act swiftly. \\u201cWe\\u2019re in a federal setup. We\\u2019ve made the law, now the state must implement it. The Centre will provide all legal and administrative support to help people reclaim their land.\\u201d\\n\\nAddressing concerns that the amendments target Muslims, Rijiju said, \\u201cThere\\u2019s a false campaign claiming we\\u2019re anti-Muslim. In fact, crores of poor Muslims have also been denied Waqf benefits. The majority get nothing. This law is not against any community.\\u201d\\n\\nHe also flagged other alleged overreaches. \\u201cIn some instances, Waqf Boards have unilaterally declared entire villages and even Parliament as Waqf property. One person even claimed a third of Delhi. These kinds of unlimited claims will no longer be allowed. Our position is very clear.\\u201d\\n\\nPublished By: Afreen Published On: Apr 15, 2025\\n\\nTune In\",\n",

The introduction of tripartite partnerships between universities, students, and industry, is expected to make education more inclusive, practical, and outcome-driven.\\n\\nIndian organizations engaged nearly one million apprentices in 2023\\u201324 (a 26 fold jump in the last five years) yet they constitute just 0.18% of the workforce, compared to 2%-3% engagement in developed countries. Scaling the AEDP model is essential to bridge India\\u2019s employability gap, considering that only 54.81% of youth are deemed employable.\\n\\nFor universities, success depends on three interventions: strong industry partnerships, robust curriculums embedded with apprenticeships, and governance for tracking and mentorship. Operational readiness\\u2014faculty training, curriculum redesign, and alignment with sector skill councils\\u2014is critical. Partnering with established Third Party Aggregators, who have the requisite experience for managing apprenticeship lifecycles, would be a key area to becoming AEDP ready.\\n\\nWith 12 million youth entering the workforce each year, AEDP offers a pragmatic path to prepare them for rapidly evolving business needs. Unlocking this potential will require policy support and institutional agility to truly harness India\\u2019s demographic dividend.\\n\\n(The author is the Chief Executive Officer, TeamLease Degree Apprenticeship)\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"Silence can be dehumanising. Nothing can match a chief minister's shocking silence over people being hacked to death or hundreds forced to flee for fear of being killed in a communal pogrom. That's what West Bengal is witnessing as Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and other Trinamool Congress leaders appeal to the aggressors, while not sparing a thought for the victims.\\n\\nRealpolitik and pragmatism should stop at the doors of death at least.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThat West Bengal is a communal cauldron in which parties have parboiled their politics is stating the obvious. But allowing mobs of a community to run riot for days shows both administrative lethargy and political licence. Then comes the abject apathy towards thousands of victims.\\n\\nWest Bengal has seen the most violent protests against the new waqf law that resulted in deaths and people fleeing their homes. Though protests erupted in several states, including Kerala, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh, no state burnt like Bengal did.\\n\\nThe timeline shows that the protests were preplanned. It also shows either a failure in the state's intelligence-gathering mechanism, or it's allowing a free run to communal mobs.\\n\\nThe Waqf Amendment Bill, 2025, was passed on April 4, and received the President's nod on April 5. Large-scale violent protests in West Bengal started only on April 11, after the Friday prayers.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nProtesters clashed with police, set fire to the homes and businesses of Hindus and looted shops. A father-son duo -- Horogobindo and Chandan Das -- were hacked to death in Mushidabad, a Muslim-majority district and epicentre of the rioting.\\n\\nA mob broke into the home of the artisans, dragged the two out, and hacked them to death even as the women of the family fell on the feet of the attackers in a desperate bid to save the men.\\n\\nHundreds of Hindus of Murshidabad, mostly women and children, fled their homes using boats to cross the Ganga to Malda.\\n\\nThe videos are out there -- people claiming the West Bengal police didn't act against the aggressors, and remained mute spectators. That, despite hours of calling police stations, there was no help and that they were left to be the prey of marauding mobs.\\n\\nThe violence continued for a second day on Saturday, and it was only after the intervention of the Calcutta High Court that central forces were deployed in rioting-hit areas of West Bengal. Incidents of violence were reported on Monday from South 24 Parganas, the district adjoining Kolkata.\\n\\nAll through the pogrom, Mamata Banerjee and other Trinamool leaders kept dealing with the rioters with kid gloves.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nOn Saturday, Mamata declared that she wouldn't be implementing the new waqf law in West Bengal. She was addressing the rioters in violence-hit areas of Murshidabad district, appealing for peace.\\n\\n\\\"We have made our position clear on this matter - we do not support this law. This law will not be implemented in our state. So what is the riot about?\\\" Mamata wrote on X.\\n\\n\\\"My sincere appeal to all people of all religions, please remain calm, remain restrained. Do not engage in any unrighteous behaviour in the name of religion. Every human life is precious. Do not incite riots for the sake of politics. Those who are inciting riots are harming the society,\\\" she further stressed.\\n\\nTrinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra appealed to Muslims with \\\"folded hands\\\" for peace. The Krishnanagar MP said she had filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court against the new law.\\n\\n\\\"Like we didn't allow NRC on the soil of Bengal, the Mamata Banerjee government wouldn't allow the waqf law to be implemented,\\\" Moitra said in a video appeal to Muslims.\\n\\nThe BJP said that no TMC minister had been arrested for inciting violence against Hindus. \\\"Because under Mamata Banerjee, hate against Hindus isn\\u2019t a crime -- it\\u2019s a strategy,\\\" it said.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nMuslims have been one of the core voter segments for the Trinamool Congress. And given the state's demography, it is a crucial vote base.\\n\\nMuslims comprised 27% of Bengal's population, according to the 2011 Census.\\n\\nAIMIM leader Imran Solanki had in March claimed that Muslims constituted 40% of Bengal's population. Last year, Kolkata Mayor and Bengal Cabinet minister Firhad Hakim said that Muslims were 33% of the state's population.\\n\\nOn the 400 Hindu families forced to flee from their homes, as BJP leader Amit Malviya claimed, TMC's Firhad Hakim said, \\\"People are relocating within Bengal, not fleeing the state. It is because West Bengal is safe that they are staying within the state.\\\" Earlier, BJP MLA Suvendu Adhikari had claimed that \\\"more than 400 Hindus from Dhulian, Murshidabad,\\\" were forced to flee the riots.\\n\\nHakim, echoed his leader Mamata Banerjee, and urged the mob to head to Delhi to protest, where the Waqf Act was passed.\\n\\n\\\"Today, they belittle exodus. Tomorrow, they will normalise extermination,\\\" said Amit Malviya, BJP's IT cell chief, slamming Hakim for branding the crisis as \\\"intra-state migration\\\".\\n\\nWhat makes the tragedy of Hindus being forced to flee their homes worse is that Bengalis across the world are celebrating April 15 as Noboborsho, the Bengali new year.\\n\\nDespite killings of Hindus and destruction of their homes and businesses by Muslim mobs, there has been no strong condemnation or display of intent from the Trinamool leadership. They have either appeared with folded hands or tried to use kid gloves for violent mobs. Such mollycoddling will not only encourage the aggressors, it will alienate the Hindus of the state.\\n\\nPublished By: Sushim Mukul Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"A Congress MLA in Tamil Nadu, Hasan Maulana, assured residents that no one would be evicted from a Vellore village where a dargah had issued eviction notices after claiming the land as Waqf property.\\n\\nHowever, he added that villagers would be required to pay a nominal rent if the Waqf Board\\u2019s claim to the land is substantiated by supporting documents. \\u201cOnce a Waqf, always a Waqf,\\u201d Maulana said.\\n\\nHis remarks came after about 150 families in Kattukollai village, in Vellore district, reportedly received notices stating that their land belongs to the Waqf.\\n\\nThe notices were issued by a person named F Syed Satham, who claimed that the land in Kattukollai belongs to a local dargah. India Today accessed a notice sent by Satham to a man named Balaji, accusing him of encroaching on Waqf land registered under survey number 362. According to the notice, Balaji had constructed a house and a shop on the property, which, as per Waqf records, belongs to the mosque.\\n\\nThe notice stated that residents must seek permission, pay ground rent, and comply with Waqf laws\\u2014or face legal eviction.\\n\\nSyed Sadam, who became caretaker of the dargah and mosque following his father's death in 2021, claims the land has belonged to the Waqf Board since 1954 and says they have documents to prove it.\\n\\nAccording to Sadam, his late father lacked formal education and awareness and therefore did not collect rent from those living on the land. Now, Sadam says he intends to rectify this by collecting rent from the residents.\\n\\nHe stated that two more notices will be sent, and if there is no response, the matter will be taken to the High Court.\\n\\nThe residents, however, say they have lived on the land for four generations and consider it their own. They are upset that Sadam is now demanding rent, whereas his father never did.\\n\\nThe issue gained attention when concerned villagers gathered at the District Collector\\u2019s office fearing eviction. Praveen Kumar, Divisional Secretary of the Hindu Munnani, said all 150 families had received similar notices, despite having government-issued documents and paying panchayat taxes. He urged the Collector to grant official land titles (patta) to the villagers, who are anxious about losing their homes and livelihoods.\\n\\nAccording to the residents, the Vellore District Collector has informally advised them not to pay rent for now.\\n\\nThis is the second such Tamil Nadu village that has been claimed by the Waqf law. Previously, a Tiruchendurai village was also sent similar notices saying the land belonged to Waqf board.\\n\\nPublished By: Preeja Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

His journey from hardship to huge success shows what grit, smart thinking, and a little rebellion against the norm can really do, reported South China Morning Post.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nNow 67, Niu is the founder of Mengniu Dairy\\u2014one of China\\u2019s biggest dairy companies\\u2014and the brain behind Aice, a renowned ice cream brand in Southeast Asia.\\n\\nNiu was born into a poor family in Inner Mongolia. His parents couldn\\u2019t afford to raise him, so they sold him to a cattle farmer.

Not long after, both his adoptive parents passed away.\\n\\nIn 1983, Niu found a job as a bottle washer in a small dairy factory. That same factory would later grow into Yili, one of China\\u2019s top dairy brands. Niu worked hard, learnt the ropes, and eventually became Vice-President of Production and Operations.

      "        \"title\": \"Why ICAI has decided to hold CA final exams thrice a year\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"Over the past decade, there has been a nearly 30% drop in student registrations \\u2014 from 3,11,000 in 2013 to just 2,24,000 in 2022.\\n\\nPhoto: Canva image\\n\\nIn a significant move towards reforming professional education in India, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has declared that, beginning in January 2025, the Chartered Accountancy (CA) Final examination will be held three times a year \\u2014 in January, May, and September. This brings the final level in line with the Foundation and Intermediate stages, which already follow a triannual exam pattern.\\n\\nThis decision has both strategic and student-centric motivations. One key factor is the increasing urgency to scale up the number of Chartered Accountants in the country. ICAI\\u2019s former President, Ranjeet Kumar Agarwal, highlighted that India will require over 30 lakh (3 million) CAs by 2047, to mark the 100th year of independence. Presently, the ICAI has around 4 lakh members and approximately 8.5 lakh active students. To meet the projected target, the country will need to produce more than 1.3 lakh qualified CAs each year \\u2014 a figure that makes the increase in exam frequency not only logical but necessary.\\n\\nAnother challenge that prompted this change is the decline in new enrolments into the CA course. Over the past decade, there has been a nearly 30% drop in student registrations \\u2014 from 3,11,000 in 2013 to just 2,24,000 in 2022. One of the key reasons is the growing popularity of global alternatives such as CPA, ACCA, and CFA, which offer higher pass percentages and more adaptable exam schedules. For instance, CFA\\u2019s pass rates stand at 45% for Level 1, 39% for Level 2, and 48% for Level 3. CPA typically sees success rates between 45% and 55%, and ACCA\\u2019s pass rates vary between 37% and 89% across its 13 papers. In contrast, the CA Final pass rate remains at a much tougher 13.44% (both groups), with Intermediate at 14.05% and Foundation at 21.52%.\\n\\nThe international context is also telling. Qualifications such as ACCA hold exams four times a year, the CPA follows a rolling schedule, and CFA exams are held between two and four times annually. The former twice-yearly model of CA exams had become an outlier. By moving to thrice-a-year attempts, ICAI is bridging that gap and aligning itself with global standards \\u2014 a step that will no doubt enhance its credibility on the world stage.\\n\\nBeyond numbers, the reform brings welcome relief to students. The current six-month gap between exam cycles often prolongs uncertainty and hampers momentum, especially for those who narrowly miss passing. With the reduced four-month interval between attempts, students can now regroup, re-evaluate, and reattempt within a shorter window. This change could significantly reduce the average time taken to complete the qualification. Additionally, ICAI has introduced multiple-choice questions (MCQs) across all papers at the Intermediate and Final stages, promoting clarity of concepts and encouraging analytical thinking.\\n\\nHowever, this increased flexibility comes with its own set of expectations. Students must avoid the temptation of attempting the exams prematurely and instead focus on solid, methodical preparation. The additional exam windows should be viewed as a chance to pace one\\u2019s studies, not to dilute the rigour of the course.\\n\\nThose who have experienced the grind of the CA journey \\u2014 the long hours, the repeated revisions, and the psychological toll of high-stakes exams \\u2014 will particularly appreciate the value of this reform. Earlier, a failed attempt often meant waiting six months to try again, which took an emotional toll. Now, with shorter wait times, aspirants have more opportunities to learn from setbacks and move forward with renewed determination.\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"Decision branded a threat to linguistic diversity and federal values, as criticism mounts from non-Hindi states\\n\\nImage by Canva\\n\\nKerala's General Education and Employment Minister, V. Sivankutty, has strongly criticised the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) for its latest decision to provide Hindi titles for English-medium textbooks. Calling the move a \\\"grave illogicality,\\\" Sivankutty accused the central government of imposing culture and denigrating India's rich linguistic diversity.\\n\\nThe Minister contended that substituting time-honored English titles with Hindi equivalents like Mridang, Santoor, and Poorvi for 1 to 6 classes is not just improper but also conveys a misguided message to young students. \\\"It is wrong to reject English titles that have been there for decades, particularly when they promote inclusivity and tolerance for language diversity in young minds,\\\" he stated on Monday.\\n\\nSivankutty emphasised that English-medium students should be given English titles, and he opined further that the title of textbooks contributes a lot towards children's imagination and worldview. He also cautioned that this action goes against federal principles and values of the Constitution.\\n\\nRatifying the views of other states that do not speak Hindi, he stated that Kerala was determined to uphold linguistic diversity and protect the cultural sovereignty of regions. \\\"Education must be a means to empowerment and respect for each other's languages, not a means for one language to dominate another,\\\" the Minister said.\\n\\nInviting collective resistance, Sivankutty called for NCERT to reverse and withdraw the changes, and appealed to all the states to stand together against what he described as \\\"unwarranted imposition\\\".\\n\\nThis controversy follows NCERT's launch of rechristened textbooks as per the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. The process of renaming has resurfaced language policy debates, with Kerala and Tamil Nadu leaders accusing the Centre of imposing Hindi through education reforms. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. K. Stalin has earlier expressed the same fears, condemning the Centre for not releasing funds to states that are reluctant to adopt the three-language formula under NEP.\",\n",

      "        \"title\": \"The role of character development in academic achievement\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"Character development is emerging as the key to holistic education, preparing students not just for exams but for life in a complex, digital world.\\n\\nImage from canva\\n\\nAmid rapid technological advancement and increasing global complexity, education stakeholders are beginning to question the adequacy of traditional academic metrics like grades and standardized tests. There is a noticeable shift toward a more holistic view of student success\\u2014one that values intellectual achievements and the development of emotional and social competencies. This evolving perspective acknowledges that character is integral to long-term success. Consequently, character development is gradually being recognized not as a supplementary aspect of education but as a core component for preparing students for the demands of a dynamic and interconnected world.\\n\\nThe shift from IQ to EQ\\n\\nIn recent years, research and educational policies have increasingly emphasised that the intelligence quotient (IQ) alone does not define a student's potential. Emotional intelligence (EQ)\\u2014encompassing traits such as self-awareness, empathy, and self-regulation\\u2014and character attributes like curiosity, resilience, and determination have emerged as equally critical for academic and personal success.\\n\\nStudents with strong emotional and character skills are better equipped to navigate academic pressures, overcome setbacks, and stay motivated through challenges. These qualities also serve as protective factors for mental well-being, reducing the risk of stress, anxiety, and burnout. When schools deliberately foster character development and socio-emotional learning, they promote inner strength and build a supportive culture where students feel safe, respected, and empowered.\\n\\nThe classroom as a character lab\\n\\nProgressive educational institutions are increasingly embracing a comprehensive approach to character development, where classrooms function as laboratories for fostering vital life skills. This goes beyond merely occasional moral science classes or motivational speeches.\\n\\nInstead, it involves establishing a culture that integrates values such as respect, responsibility, and empathy into daily teaching and interactions. Collaborative projects, debates, and open discussions can encourage teamwork, empathy, and critical thinking, while supportive educators can assist students in learning from their mistakes and building resilience.\\n\\nNurturing character in the digital world\\n\\nIn the digital age, character development extends beyond physical classrooms and playgrounds into online interactions. Cultivating digital citizenship becomes essential as students increasingly engage with social media, collaborative tools, and digital platforms. This involves fostering responsible, respectful, and ethical behaviour in virtual environments\\u2014whether refraining from cyberbullying, respecting intellectual property, or maintaining honesty in online academic submissions.\\n\\nBy integrating digital responsibility into character education, schools can help students navigate the complexities of the digital world with integrity. Encouraging critical thinking about online behaviour strengthens students' moral compasses and prepares them to become thoughtful, empathetic contributors to the global digital community.\\n\\nHolistic education: An emerging trend\\n\\nA notable development in global education policy is the growing emphasis on holistic education, which seeks to cultivate students' intellectual, emotional, social, and ethical development. International bodies such as the OECD and UNESCO have underscored the importance of this paradigm, advocating for educational systems that not only equip learners with academic skills but also enable them to thrive in complex and dynamic contexts.\\n\\nReflecting the global shift toward holistic education, India\\u2019s National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 emphasizes value-based learning and integrating socio-emotional learning (SEL) into the curriculum. By moving beyond rote learning and exam-driven models, the policy aims to foster critical thinking, empathy, and ethical awareness\\u2014preparing students to become academically proficient, emotionally resilient, and socially responsible individuals.\\n\\nThe educator\\u2019s role: Shaping character through action\\n\\nEducators are central to a student\\u2019s character journey\\u2014not just as instructors but as role models and mentors. Their authenticity, fairness, and empathy set the tone for a positive, value-driven learning environment. Students often absorb these behaviors, making it crucial for teachers to lead by example.\\n\\nCharacter development also unfolds through how teachers face challenges, transform mistakes into learning opportunities, and promote respectful dialogue. Structured mentorship, peer support, and reflective activities enhance students' emotional and ethical growth. Educators help integrate character education into the school culture by collaborating with families and demonstrating consistency and values. Ultimately, their daily actions leave the most lasting impact on a student\\u2019s development.\\n\\nAs the world becomes more complex, education must evolve to address the full spectrum of human potential. While knowledge and technical skills can open doors, character\\u2014resilience, empathy, integrity, and purpose\\u2014ultimately determines how far a student will go. Institutions that nurture intellectual and moral development empower learners to succeed academically and thrive as responsible, adaptable citizens in a rapidly changing world.\\n\\nThe time has come to reimagine classrooms as spaces where values are lived, not merely taught. When educators lead purposefully, mindfully utilize digital platforms, and prioritize mental well-being alongside academic rigor, we create an education system that prepares students for exams and life.\\n\\nThe author is the Dean (Training), Chair (Placement & Corporate Relations), Assistant Professor (Business Analytics), Jaipuria Institute of Management, Jaipur.\",\n",

The rise of new technologies, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI), has influenced placement dynamics, affecting the number of companies participating in campus placements.\\n\\nA placement officer from an IIIT in South India noted, \\\"There has been a decrease in the number of companies visiting the institute for placements now compared to previous years due to changes in the market trends because of new technologies like AI.

Already criticised in the past for its handling of major entrance tests, the agency now faces serious questions over its credibility.\\n\\nAfter the publication of answer keys, question papers, and candidates\\u2019 recorded responses, several students\\u2014particularly from Kota, known for its coaching institutions\\u2014have highlighted errors in the examination. At least nine questions from physics, chemistry, and mathematics subjects have been challenged. These concerns have been reinforced by expert evaluations from reputed coaching institutes, further calling into question the NTA\\u2019s accuracy and transparency.\\n\\nAmong the disputed questions, four are from physics, three from chemistry, and two from mathematics. According to subject experts, these are not minor discrepancies but clear factual mistakes.\\n\\nA coaching institute director confirmed that objections, along with supporting evidence, have been officially submitted. He urged the NTA to either award grace marks or exclude the problematic questions from evaluation. One example flagged by a physics faculty member involves a question on hydrogen-like ions. The answer given by NTA is based on an atomic number of 2, while the correct value should be 3. Another disputed item in the current electricity section shows an answer of 125mA instead of the correct value, which is 5mA. A separate question on equivalent resistance reportedly did not contain any valid answer among the options given.\\n\\nStudents, along with coaching centres, are now awaiting the NTA\\u2019s formal response to the raised objections.\\n\\nHowever, the incident has further damaged public trust in the agency. With the JEE Main playing a pivotal role in university admissions\\u2014and with each mark carrying significant weight\\u2014pressure is increasing on the NTA to not only address these specific errors but also to undertake a wider reform of its examination processes.\",\n",

      "        \"title\": \"Why personalised 1-on-1 coaching outperforms traditional business education\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"In a rapidly evolving business world, personalised coaching provides real-time, emotionally intelligent support that bridges the gap between knowledge and action\\u2014giving entrepreneurs the clarity, confidence, and edge to lead effectively.\\n\\nPhoto: Canva image\\n\\nIn a world where industries take overnight turns and decisions need to be made in real time, business leaders are more frequently looking for support beyond the traditional establishment of education. MBAs and structured programmes still have a place in this conversation; they provide foundational understanding, strategic frameworks, and access to useful networks or opportunities. However, they do not always attend to the urgency, uniqueness, and emotional complexity that an entrepreneur experiences in real time.\\n\\nThis is where personalised 1-on-1 coaching fits in\\u2014not as a replacement for, or a shortage of, valuable education, but as the edge many entrepreneurs now recognise as necessary. Once thought of as a value-add or last-resort addition, coaching has become a pragmatic strategic investment made by founders who want to grow and evolve in their role with clarity, speed, and confidence.\\n\\nA different kind of growth tool\\n\\nEntrepreneurs today face considerably more than predictable strategy. They must continuously have the capacity to adapt in real time, lead through uncertainty, and make decisions with imperfect information. In many cases, an educational background in business is not designed for such fluidity.\\n\\nCoaching is inherently directed at the present, tailored to the founder\\u2019s specific context, industry, leadership style, and objectives. Whether the aim is to scale faster, expand the business footprint, or make an outright directional shift, 1-on-1 coaching will focus the entrepreneur on achieving the outcome they are pursuing.\\n\\nNot a service for the stuck, but fuel for the fast movers\\n\\nThere can be a false sense that coaching is only for people who are struggling or in pain. In our day and age, that is far from the truth. More and more high-performing entrepreneurs are looking for coaches not because they are failing, but because they want to grow differently.\\n\\nFor some, it is about speed\\u2014providing acceleration for growth. For others, it is about width\\u2014offering a greater vision. And for many, it is about depth\\u2014aligning business goals and objectives with their personal hopes and dreams or being intentional about the culture they are building. You see, today's coach is not just a sounding board. A coach is often a strategic thought partner to help bring perspective, structure, and accountability.\\n\\nThe power of a non-judgemental fellow traveller\\n\\nBeing an entrepreneur can be an overwhelming experience. Even in rooms filled with other employees, partners, or investors, a founder may struggle to be candid about their doubts, fears, or possible decisions. It is often difficult to find a place to sort through all these thoughts without judgement or fear of ramifications.\\n\\nThis is where a coach is uniquely positioned\\u2014somebody who is outside of the company but passionately committed to the founder's success. A fellow traveller who can share in the highs and lows while providing clarity without an agenda. With a coach, an entrepreneur can think out loud, challenge themselves, or reset when necessary\\u2014all while being free of the pressure to perform.\\n\\nFrom learning to action\\n\\nA regular dysfunction in conventional learning environments is the time lag between learning and doing. Knowledge is important, but it is action that drives results. The value of coaching for clients is in creating a bridge from conversation to plan, and from plan to action and outcomes\\u2014with effective accountability built into the process.\\n\\nAdditionally, coaching evolves adaptively throughout the year. Strategies are revisited, priorities recalibrated, and wins celebrated\\u2014not just quarterly, but weekly. This regular rhythm of applied learning creates not only effective coaching, but sustainable coaching.\\n\\nThe future is personalised\\n\\nThe issue isn\\u2019t whether an MBA or advanced education is worthwhile\\u2014it generally is. But the world of entrepreneurship is changing, and what leaders need now is customised, real-time, emotionally intelligent support. Coaching provides that advantage. In today\\u2019s world, 1-on-1 coaching is not a sign of weakness. It\\u2019s an indication of purposeful leadership. For a professional entrepreneur acting in a complicated environment, it\\u2019s no longer a luxury, but a tactic.\\n\\n(The author is a Business & Leadership Coach)\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"India\\u2019s tech sector is shifting from degree-based hiring to a skills-first approach, driven by digital transformation and evolving industry demands\\n\\nImage by Canva\\n\\nIndia\\u2019s tech sector is undergoing a quiet but decisive shift. Companies that once prioritised academic qualifications from top institutions are now rethinking how they identify talent. Skills\\u2014particularly those that match real-time business needs\\u2014are taking centre stage. Whether it is in AI, cybersecurity, or green tech, recruiters are leaning toward a more agile, outcomes-based approach to talent acquisition.\\n\\nThis change is rooted both in trend and necessity. According to Mercer | Mettl, only 45 per cent of recent graduates have the skills employers seek. The lag between education and industry expectations is increasing, as companies rush to implement next-gen technologies without the workforce to support them.\\n\\nThe World Economic Forum projects that by 2025, 97 million new roles will emerge globally, powered by AI, robotics, and IoT.\\n\\nRahul Veerwal, CEO and co-founder of GetWork, explains how this shift is unfolding in real time, \\u201cAt GetWork, we have witnessed how AI is rapidly driving the shift toward skill-based hiring by empowering companies to assess candidates on real-world capabilities rather than just academic credentials. Technology is uncovering hidden talent in Tier 2 and 3 cities\\u2014individuals who may lack elite degrees but have the skills to excel. This evolution is making the hiring process more inclusive, efficient, and aligned with the demands of the modern workforce.\\u201d\\n\\nA LinkedIn report, India Future of Recruiting 2023, found that 75 per cent of recruiters now believe skills-first hiring is the next step. For technology roles, employers are targeting proficiencies in data science, machine learning, blockchain, and cloud infrastructure\\u2014areas that often require hands-on exposure rather than just theory.\\n\\nKorn Ferry\\u2019s research reinforces this shift, indicating that organisations hiring based on skills are 57 per cent more likely to adapt to changes and meet evolving challenges effectively. These organisations are hiring talent that can transition across roles, collaborate across disciplines, and think beyond traditional job descriptions.\\n\\nReflecting on this transition from the skilling side, JPS Kohli, Founder & Group CEO, SkillUp noted, \\u201cAt SkillUp, we believe the future of hiring belongs to those who can do, not just those who know. The industry is moving beyond traditional degrees towards skills that speak for themselves. Today\\u2019s employers need talent that is ready to deliver from day one, with real-world experience and problem-solving ability. That is why our learning approach is deeply learner-centric \\u2014 focused on outcomes, flexibility, and partnerships with global tech leaders.\\u201d\\n\\nThis whole shift is tied closely to how fast digital transformation is happening. AI, for example, is being picked up across industries, with sectors like BFSI and tech moving fastest.\\n\\nMeanwhile, hiring patterns across sectors are also reflecting the move to specialized skillsets. IT firms are scouting for talent in programming and AI integration; Fintech wants blockchain engineers and cybersecurity professionals, while investment banks are on the lookout for data analysts and algorithm specialists. In each case, the capability to solve problems and innovate in real-time outweighs the need for academic laurels.\\n\\nThis has prompted education and skilling platforms to rethink how they structure their offerings. Industry-led certifications, boot camps, and apprenticeship programs are now becoming viable alternatives to full-time degrees. Some platforms are designing learning experiences around real-world scenarios, often teaming up with industry players to make it as practical as possible.\\n\\nThe push toward this model is also helping address regional talent disparities. As Rahul Veerwal of GetWork points out, AI-powered recruitment tools are enabling employers to tap into previously overlooked talent pools in smaller cities. This is making the tech hiring process not only more accurate but also more democratic.\\n\\nRecruitment models are also evolving to support this change. Tech-driven assessments, scenario-based evaluations, and AI-enabled screening tools are replacing conventional resumes and interviews.

      "        \"title\": \"Equity over inclusion: The role of mentorship and returnship for women in tech\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"Mentorship and returnship programmes are transforming the workplace into a space where everyone can thrive.\\n\\nImage by canva\\n\\nTalent is spread across a diverse spectrum, and to thrive in the competitive market, organisations today need to be well-prepared to embrace & harness this diversity to deliver more together. While the Indian technology sector has experienced a positive increase in the number of women in the field, the representation of women in decision-making, innovation, and research-based roles is still limited. These gaps call for a shift beyond Diversity and Inclusion.\\n\\nTrue progress needs ''Equity,'' ensuring that women have the resources, opportunities, and systemic support they need to grow at every stage of their careers. It's recognising the unique challenges women face and providing the resources, opportunities, and support needed to thrive rather than expecting them to navigate barriers on their own. In the end, we need a diverse range of perspectives that lead to more balanced and sustainable decisions.\\n\\nEmployers investing in growth opportunities for women unlock great potential, driving innovation and strengthening their workforce.\\n\\nInitiatives such as mentorship, returnships, leadership development programmes, upkilling and reskilling, employee resource groups, women's leadership groups, or even an in-house creche can create pathways for career advancement. By implementing initiatives like the above, companies can empower women leaders and build a more inclusive and dynamic workplace.\\n\\nThe power of mentorship\\n\\nEffective mentorship goes beyond traditional learning - it inspires, connects, and drives lasting change. When organisations cultivate a strong culture of mentorship, they enable an environment where everyone feels supported, grows together, and makes a meaningful impact.\\n\\nMentorship can come in many forms. From senior mentorship, peer-to-peer guidance, or reverse mentorship, all these relationships enable continuous learning in the workplace and ensure that everyone progresses together.\\n\\nMany companies like Hexagon R&D India have recognised the power of mentorship. They are integrating it into their culture through structured programs. Our Programs like MentHer connect women with mentors for guidance and networking, while the Gengage program facilitates reverse mentorship between Gen-Z employees and senior leaders and the WILL Program connects women with a supportive peer network for collaboration.\\n\\nA well-structured mentorship program is crucial for women navigating male-dominated tech world. It's not just about guidance, it\\u2019s about empowerment. Investing in it not only strengthens the leadership pipeline but also drives innovation and a forward-thinking organisation.\\n\\nThink of a workplace where women have access to experienced mentors who support their aspirations and offer insights, encouragement, and direction. It\\u2019s a space where they can openly share experiences and challenges with senior professionals, learning from their journeys. This kind of network accelerates personal and professional development and continuous learning.\\n\\nAlso, it is great for everyone involved. Having mentored two women leaders every quarter, for many years, I've seen firsthand how mentorship is mutually rewarding. Additionally, the impact extends beyond individual relationships, creating an environment with free-flowing knowledge and multiplying opportunities.\\n\\nEffective mentorship should go beyond traditional learning and aim to inspire, connect, and create lasting change. A workplace that prioritises mentorship is not just nurturing talent, it is shaping the leaders of tomorrow.\\n\\nNew pathway forward with returnship programmes\\n\\nCareer breaks are common, and they could be for various reasons like motherhood, caregiving, mental health, or just a break. Yet, these breaks are often viewed as taboo, with organisations still hesitant to hire women who have taken a break. What we tend to overlook is that returning candidates often come back stronger and more well-rounded, with renewed energy and broader perspectives. As technology evolves rapidly, adapting to new skills and tools should not be a challenge for them.\\n\\nReturnship programmes provide a valuable opportunity to help diverse candidates transition back into the workforce, bringing fresh insights, energy, and experiences. Embracing this talent pool drives inclusivity and taps into an underutilised resource of capable professionals eager to contribute.\\n\\nOrganisations, including Hexagon R&D India, are proactively supporting professionals returning to the workforce. One such initiative is the Begin.Again program, designed to help women transition back after a career break. Through highly paid internships and a guaranteed full-time offer upon successful completion, the programme provides an inclusive and supportive pathway to re-enter the workforce.\\n\\nAt Hexagon R&D India, we have a no-questions policy, meaning we do not enquire about the reasons behind a woman's career break. Through this approach, we ensure that returning candidates are not judged on their gaps solely on their capabilities and potential.\\n\\nThe success of Begin Again has been remarkable, with candidates who have taken breaks of up to 14 years achieving conversion rates of over 90 per cent into full-time roles. Additionally, these returning colleagues show higher levels of engagement and often become champions of workplace inclusivity, further enriching the organisational culture.\\n\\nWhen organisations invest in meaningful reintegration, they unlock untapped potential and strengthen their workforce in the future.\\n\\nA call to action\\n\\nEquity is a mindset that drives change. We need to create workplaces where everyone can lead, innovate and thrive. Companies that take action will not only drive diversity but also a stronger more dynamic industry for the future.\\n\\nThe author is the Senior Vice President and Head, Hexagon R&D India.\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"AI is breaking digital barriers and redefining accessibility, empowering persons with disabilities to thrive and lead in an inclusive digital world.\\n\\nImage from canva\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is at the forefront of global innovation, driving advancements across various sectors. According to PwC projections, AI is expected to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Industries have transformed through AI to deliver better results and improved user experiences. AI's impact on accessibility solutions is no exception. It has made significant strides in enhancing accessibility and improving the user experience, especially for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs).\\n\\nWhile organisations and society have made progress in physical accessibility, digital accessibility still lags behind. Efforts have been made, but much more is needed. In this age, digital platforms are now the most popular and convenient way to consume information, and barriers to digital accessibility hinder the growth of PwDs. Limited access to digital resources poses significant challenges for PwDs, affecting their ability to access essential services such as education, employment, and information. According to the WHO, nearly 1.3 billion people worldwide, or 16% of the global population, experience some form of disability. For this large population, digital accessibility is not a luxury but a necessity.\\n\\nAI as an enabler for accessibility\\n\\nAI-powered accessibility solutions play a crucial role in creating an inclusive environment for individuals with disabilities. These solutions enhance navigation, usability, and communication, catering to diverse needs. By leveling the playing field, AI empowers PwDs to pursue growth and development opportunities.\\n\\nHere are some ways AI-powered solutions enable accessibility and foster inclusivity:\\n\\nTransformative AI Technologies for Accessibility\\n\\na) AI and assistive technologies\\n\\nAI has transformed the landscape of assistive technologies, presenting significant advancements for PwDs. Amid these advancements, text-to-speech cloning technology stands out as a game-changer. By leveraging AI to study and mimic an individual's distinct vocal traits, it enables people who have lost their ability to speak to express themselves using a voice that closely mirrors their own. This is not only a technological marvel but a reflection of how AI can serve humanity by replicating and enhancing fundamental human abilities.\\n\\nb) Predictive AI and communication\\n\\nAI enhances communication for PwD individuals through its predictive text capabilities. With word suggestions or even entire phrases, AI reduces the time and effort required for users to convey their thoughts. This not only accelerates interactions but also reduces the cognitive burden, streamlining the entire communication process. For people who may struggle with traditional input methods, AI's intuitive prediction mechanisms can anticipate their needs and facilitate a smoother exchange of ideas. This aspect of AI is a crucial development in making digital communication more accessible.\\n\\nc) Automated testing and scanning\\n\\nAutomated AI scanners play an essential role in detecting accessibility issues on websites. By performing extensive tests aligned with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), these tools streamline compliance efforts and improve usability, promoting a more inclusive digital experience.\\n\\nEnhancing digital experiences with AI\\n\\na) Improved virtual assistance\\n\\nAI-powered virtual assistants such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant have become tools of utmost importance for the PwD individuals. These AI assistants offer personalised solutions, adapting to the preferences and needs of various user groups. Right from controlling smart home devices to setting up alarm clocks, these virtual assistants make lives easier for PwDs.\\n\\nb)Better audio and video captioning\\n\\nAI excels in generating real-time captions for audio and video content. Automated transcription tools and advanced lip-reading capabilities provide crucial support for individuals with hearing impairments, ensuring they can access and engage with multimedia content.\\n\\nc) Image recognition and alt-text generation\\n\\nAI-powered image recognition technology automatically generates alt-text for images, enabling visually impaired users to understand visual content. This capability bridges accessibility gaps by offering real-time descriptions, making digital content more inclusive and informative.\\n\\nAI is poised to revolutionise accessibility for PwDs, unlocking new possibilities for a fully inclusive workforce. By seamlessly eliminating digital barriers, AI will enable organisations to create dynamic, forward-thinking workplaces where PwDs can thrive with equal opportunities for growth alongside their peers. With advanced tools, personalised training, and adaptive technologies, companies will empower PwDs to deliver groundbreaking results. Embracing digital accessibility is not just a progressive step; it is an essential part of shaping the future of work in a truly inclusive world.\\n\\nThe author is the Executive Vice President \\u2013 Global Corporate Communications, CSR, DEI and ESG, HGS\",\n",

To address these, edForce employs its specialised Training Need Analysis (TNA) framework, which helps identify existing skill gaps and curate training programmes accordingly.\\n\\nFor instance, while IT companies may require advanced training in cloud computing, cybersecurity, and AI, manufacturing firms might seek expertise in automation, IoT, and robotics. edForce takes these specific needs into account and offers customised learning modules that align with industry trends and business goals.\\n\\nCustom-built learning solutions\\n\\nUnlike traditional training providers that offer generic courses, edForce develops bespoke learning solutions tailored to an organisation\\u2019s unique objectives. These solutions are meticulously designed by collaborating with industry leaders and subject matter experts. Some of the ways edForce personalises its training programs include:\\n\\n1. Customised Course Content \\u2013 Training modules are tailored to align with the latest technological advancements and business requirements of the respective industries.\\n\\n2. Role-Specific Training \\u2013 Programs are structured to meet the needs of different roles within an organisation, ensuring relevance and applicability.\\n\\n3. Live and On-Demand Learning \\u2013 A mix of instructor-led live sessions and on-demand content ensures flexibility for working professionals.\\n\\n4. Hands-On Labs and Simulations \\u2013 edForce provides CloudLabs, enabling employees to gain real-world experience in a controlled environment.\\n\\n5. Assessment and Certification \\u2013 To ensure competency and knowledge retention, edForce integrates assessments and globally recognised certifications into its training programmes.\\n\\nA partner in learning and development\\n\\nWhat sets edForce apart is its end-to-end ownership of the training cycle. Instead of merely offering a trainer and content, the company assumes full responsibility for managing the entire learning journey. This approach allows businesses to focus on their core operations while edForce takes care of training execution, tracking, and impact measurement.\\n\\nAdditionally, edForce\\u2019s deep engagement with businesses ensures that upskilling efforts are aligned with the company\\u2019s strategic vision. By acting as an extended L&D arm, the platform helps organisations build a sustainable learning culture that drives long-term growth.\\n\\nExpanding horizons: Beyond IT\\n\\nWhile edForce has established a strong presence in the IT sector, the company is now expanding into non-IT industries such as banking, healthcare, and retail. By doing so, it is widening its course offerings to address emerging needs in these sectors. For example:\\n\\nBanking & Finance \\u2013 Training in fintech, blockchain, and risk management.\\n\\nHealthcare \\u2013 Upskilling in healthcare analytics, digital health solutions, and AI-driven diagnostics.\\n\\nRetail & E-commerce \\u2013 Courses in supply chain analytics, customer data management, and AI-driven personalisation.\\n\\nPartnership with industry leaders\\n\\nA crucial factor that enables edForce to deliver top-tier upskilling solutions is its collaboration with leading global enterprises. By forging strong partnerships with industry giants such as Infosys, Walmart, Siemens, Microsoft, Dell, and Amazon, edForce designs and delivers training programs that directly align with the specific skill needs of these organisations. These partnerships not only reinforce edForce\\u2019s credibility as a premier upskilling provider but also ensure that learners receive industry-approved training that meets the highest global standards.\\n\\nFuture roadmap\\n\\nWith a remarkable YOY growth of over 500% and a recovering revenue of Rs 25 Cr. for FY 24-25, edForce is set to expand globally. The company is investing in technological infrastructure, AI-driven learning platforms, and strategic partnerships to enhance its training offerings further. As the demand for upskilling and reskilling continues to grow, edForce remains committed to delivering cutting-edge training solutions that empower businesses and professionals alike.\\n\\nedForce\\u2019s ability to deliver industry-specific, customised upskilling programs has positioned it as a leader in workforce development. By focusing on targeted skill enhancement, end-to-end training management, and real-world application, the company is effectively bridging the skills gap across multiple sectors. As edForce continues to innovate and expand, it is well on its way to redefining the future of professional learning and development in India and beyond.\\n\\nThe author is the CEO & Co-Founder of edForce.\",\n",

      "        \"title\": \"How affordable online MBA programs are transforming business education\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"The pursuit of an MBA program has long been a hallmark of career progression for business professionals. However, the costs of the traditional MBA route\\u2014including hefty tuition fees, relocation costs, and the opportunity cost of a career pause\\u2014have often deterred many from taking the plunge. The rise of online MBA programs has changed the landscape, offering a more flexible and cost-effective alternative without compromising quality or professional commitments.\\n\\nThe growing popularity of online MBA programs\\n\\nAs India aims to enroll 92 million students in higher education institutions by 2035, scalable and accessible learning solutions have become increasingly essential. Online MBA programs offer business professionals an opportunity to upskill without pausing their careers. With regulatory support reinforcing their credibility, these programs are now widely accepted. Over 500 UGC-approved online degree programs are currently offered by nearly 95 universities across India. Furthermore, the UGC has declared online degrees equivalent to traditional on-campus degrees in terms of academic rigor and professional recognition, making them a trusted option among employers. Unlike traditional programs that involve high campus maintenance and administrative costs, online\\n\\nMBA programs leverage digital platforms to reduce expenses. India\\u2019s digital expansion\\u2014marked by 1.2 billion smartphone users and an estimated 900 million internet users by the end of 2025\\u2014has further driven the accessibility and affordability of these programs.\\n\\nWhat makes an online MBA affordable?\\n\\nAn online MBA program\\u2019s trademark feature is affordability. Traditional institutions incur heavy costs for campus upkeep, staff housing, and administration expenses. However, online programs use digital platforms to provide qualitative education at much lower expenses, which becomes applicable to many students seeking financial assistance. The increased digital ecosystem available in India drastically improves affordability. With over a billion smartphone users, online education is simpler than ever. Since professionals from varying socioeconomic classes are now able to afford internet services, pursuing an online\\n\\nMBA without relocation or commuting is far from being a distant reality. The flexible structure of an online MBA further contributes to its affordability. With open-term dates, online MBA programs frequently use the modular method. Students have the flexibility to enroll in micro-courses, earn stackable credentials, and progress through courses at their own speed. Many institutions adopt a competency-based learning approach where practical, employable skills are taught without excessive and unnecessary coursework, allowing the students to maximize their educational value.\\n\\nIn addition, strategic collaboration with industry giants has also increased the credibility of programs offered online. As corporations have come to recognize the value of investing in their employees' reskilling by paying in advance, these partnerships assist many companies in establishing subsidized tuition. Employers are increasingly funding employee education through affordable tuition fees or sponsoring MBAs, which eases the cost burden on students while meeting industry demands.\\n\\nTo minimize financial barriers, many online MBA programs provide flexible payment schedules, scholarships, and deferred payment plans through income-share agreements. These programs allow new workers to finish a course and start a job without financial strain, as payments can be made in installments after getting hired.\\n\\nHow to evaluate an affordable online MBA?\\n\\nWhen looking for an affordable online MBA program, it is important to understand that low price does not mean low quality. Accreditation is a critical factor as bodies like AMBA, AACSB, or EQUIS also offer global credibility for a high level of recognition. Moreover, well-accredited MBAs ensure that the graduates remain competitive beyond the local job market.\\n\\nReturn on Investment (ROI) is a factor equally important to accreditation. There is no doubt that an MBA program from a reputable institution would offer positive career outcomes like salary increases, fast-tracked career growth, and employment at top-tier corporations. It is crucial that prospective students consider alumni success stories to determine the employability benefits and overall ROI of the program.\\n\\nAnother crucial factor to consider when evaluating an online MBA program is its approach to learning. Quality programs that integrate innovative and non-conventional teaching strategies like case-study methods, simulations, AI personalized learning approaches, and several others, guarantee a vastly superior educational experience and skill outcome.\\n\\nAdditionally, accessibility is also greatly affected by the flexibility of the learning model. Most asynchronous online MBA programs allow students to attend classes at any time, complete assignments at their own pace, and get instructions in person or remotely, which makes it easier for full-time professionals to meet their academic goals without halting their professional growth or compromising personal commitments.\\n\\nNetworking opportunities are another key factor that distinguishes a good online MBA program. While physical campuses, by their nature, help in networking, an online program should offer digital networking opportunities, alumni engagement, mentorship programs, and other avenues for similar industry engagement. These features allow students to expand industry connections and professional reach through a virtual format.\\n\\nUnlike elite business schools that charge premium tuition fees, affordable online MBA programs have unique advantages. These institutions' ability to rapidly adopt new technologies, as well as shifts in business practices, makes them a proactive alternative to more traditional institutions. In addition, these programs appeal to students from many different professional and cultural backgrounds, which enhances collaboration.\\n\\nFinal thoughts\\n\\nThere's no doubt that the online MBA landscape is shifting, and business education is evolving to include skill-based learning and corporate training. With growing emphasis on AI integration, immersive learning experiences, micro-MBA, and specialized executive programs, online MBA programs hold a significant edge over on-site, traditional alternatives. Consequently, we expect the demand for affordable, high-quality online MBA programs to continue to rise. With government policies supporting higher education expansion and technological advancements making digital learning more immersive, the online MBA market is set to grow significantly, with the projected size of India\\u2019s online higher education market expected to reach Rs 85,000 crores by FY 2028, growing at a CAGR of 23.1%.\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"A single-page declassified CIA document has gone viral for its bizarre claim detailing a clash between Soviet soldiers and aliens - an encounter that allegedly ended with 23 Russian troops being turned to stone.\\n\\nThe incident reportedly took place during the Cold War era, around 1989 or 1990, during a military training exercise in Siberia. It came to light after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, when the KGB was dissolved. A 250-page report compiled by the KGB - later acquired by the CIA - recounted the extraordinary events that unfolded after a Soviet military unit allegedly spotted a UFO.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThe document includes numerous photographs, drawings, and eyewitness testimonies from participants in the event. A CIA representative described the case as \\\"a horrific picture of revenge on the part of extraterrestrial creatures, a picture that makes one's blood freeze.\\\"\\n\\nThe report claims, \\\"A quite low-flying spaceship in the shape of a saucer appeared above a military unit that was conducting routine training manoeuvres. For unknown reasons, somebody unexpectedly launched a surface-to-air missile and hit the UFO. It fell to earth not far away, and five short humanoids with large heads and large black eyes emerged from it.\\\"\\n\\nTwo soldiers, who remained alive after freeing themselves from the debris, testified, \\\"The aliens came close together and then merged into a single object that acquired a spherical shape. That object began to buzz and hiss sharply, and then became brilliant white. In a few seconds, the spheres grew much bigger and exploded by flaring up with an extremely bright light.\\\"\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n\\\"At that very instant, 23 soldiers who had watched the phenomenon turned into... stone poles,\\\" recalled the soldiers who survived as they stood in the shade and were less exposed to the luminous explosion.\\n\\nThe KGB report claimed that the 'petrified soldiers' and remains of the UFO were transported to a secret scientific research facility near Moscow. Soviet specialists allegedly concluded that an 'unknown energy source had instantaneously altered the soldiers' biological structure, transforming them into a substance with the same molecular composition as limestone'.\\n\\nThe CIA concluded the report by saying, \\\"If the KGB file corresponds to reality, this is an extremely menacing case. The aliens possess such weapons and technology that go beyond all our assumptions. They can stand up for themselves if attacked.\\\"\\n\\nThe CIA document was declassified in 2000 and was originally covered by Weekly World News in Canada and the Ukrainian newspaper Holos Ukrayiny. The story resurfaced in 2024 when it was featured on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast.\",\n",

The projection comes with a model error margin of 5%, officials announced on Tuesday.\\n\\nThe southwest monsoon typically begins its advance over Kerala around June 1 and withdraws by mid-September. The projected above-average rainfall could provide a much-needed lift to the agricultural sector, the Ministry of Earth Sciences said.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nAccording to the IMD, this year\\u2019s forecast suggests that most parts of the country are likely to benefit from favourable rainfall conditions, with the exception of a few regions. Rainfall is expected to be below normal in Ladakh, the Northeast, and Tamil Nadu during the four-month monsoon season.\\n\\nThe IMD defines normal rainfall as between 96% and 104% of the 50-year average of 87 cm (about 35 inches). Any amount above this range is considered \\u201cabove normal.\\u201d\\n\\nThe officials said all key climate factors \\u2014 including the El Nino and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) \\u2014 are currently in a neutral phase. These neutral conditions are considered favourable for a healthy monsoon.\\n\\nEl Nino refers to a climate pattern where the surface waters of the central and eastern Pacific Ocean become warmer than usual, often leading to weaker monsoons and less rainfall in India. The Indian Ocean Dipole refers to a weather phenomenon in the Indian Ocean where the difference in sea surface temperatures between the western and eastern parts affects rainfall. A positive IOD usually brings more rain to India, while a negative IOD can reduce it.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nApart from these, another positive indicator this year is the reduced snow cover over Eurasia and the Himalayan region. Historically, lower snow cover in these areas has been associated with stronger monsoon rainfall in India.\\n\\nWith favourable ocean and atmospheric conditions in place, this year\\u2019s monsoon is expected to be above-average and provide much-needed relief to the agricultural sector.\\n\\nPublished By: sharangee Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has said that visas and immigration statuses for nine of its international students and researchers were revoked without any prior warning or explanation. The move comes as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration as well as an attempt to temper the activism that they perceive as hostile to conservatives.\\n\\nTill now, the US government has cancelled the visas of nearly 530 students, faculty and researchers across 88 colleges and universities, as per a report by CBS.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nIn a letter to the MIT community, university president Sally Kornbluth on Monday expressed concern over the recent government actions that, she said, threatened not just MIT's operations but also the country's ability to attract top global talent and maintain scientific leadership.\\n\\n\\\"Since April 4, nine members of our community - students, recent graduates and postdocs - have had their visas and immigration status unexpectedly revoked,\\\" Kornbluth wrote, adding that the lack of any official communication or rationale from the government was alarming.\\n\\nWhile the institute was not directly involved in the lawsuit filed by one affected student, it says it remained \\\"extremely concerned\\\" about the broader implications.\\n\\n\\\"These actions are interfering with the normal functioning of MIT,\\\" Kornbluth said. \\\"They diminish our ability both to serve the nation and to attract the world's finest talent.\\\"\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThe visa revocations come alongside a separate federal policy shift that prompted MIT and several other top-tier universities, including Princeton, Caltech and the University of Illinois, to sue the Department of Energy (DOE) in a Boston federal court.\\n\\nThe lawsuit challenges the administration's sudden decision to cap indirect research cost reimbursements at 15 per cent, a move that could result in hundreds of millions in lost funding for academic institutions engaged in high-stakes research.\\n\\nIndirect costs cover vital infrastructure and services that support scientific research but aren't tied to a specific project. These include safety protocols, facility maintenance, data storage and compliance systems. MIT noted that nearly 1,000 members of its community rely on DOE grants, which were now at risk.\\n\\nIn her letter, Kornbluth said the cuts would \\\"devastate scientific research at America\\u2019s universities\\\" and hurt the country's long-term innovation prospects.\\n\\n\\\"To find those rare people (with exceptional talent), we open ourselves to talent from every corner of the US and from around the globe,\\\" she wrote. \\\"The threat of unexpected visa revocations will make it less likely that top talent from around the world will come to the US - and that will damage American competitiveness and scientific leadership for years to come.\\\"\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThe Department of Energy announced the new cap on April 11, saying it would make federal research spending more transparent and efficient. But universities say the change is unfair and disruptive, especially since many had already agreed on much higher reimbursement rates. For example, the University of Michigan could lose over USD 30 million because of this new rule.\\n\\nThis is the second time in recent months that universities have been forced into court over similar actions. Earlier this year, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) imposed a similar funding cap, which was then challenged in court. A federal judge issued a permanent injunction halting those cuts while the case proceeds.\\n\\nThe government is using funds to negotiate with the universities and ensure they comply with the directives. The punishment for defiance is freezing of funding, like with Harvard University.\\n\\nThe Trump administration on Monday froze approximately USD 2.3 billion in federal funding to Harvard University after the Ivy League school refused to comply with a list of White House demands to limit activism on campus and dismantle its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes.\\n\\nThe freeze includes USD 2.2 billion in grants and USD 60 million in federal contracts, according to the department's task force on combating antisemitism, which said Harvard's resistance reflected \\\"the troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation's most prestigious universities\\\".\\n\\n(With inputs from Reuters)\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"After days of turmoil triggered by US President Donald Trump\\u2019s tariff strikes, Dalal Street seems to have found its feet again. Indian equities roared back to life on Tuesday, with both the Sensex and Nifty surging over 2%, effectively wiping out all losses incurred since the shock announcement on April 2.\\n\\nTrading resumed after a long weekend, but there was no slowdown in terms of momentum. The Nifty50 climbed as much as 2.4% intraday, comfortably reclaiming its pre-tariff territory, while the Sensex gained over 1,600 points.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nBroader markets mirrored the optimism, with small-cap and mid-cap indices also posting solid gains. Both the main market indices are set to close the trading session on a strong note.\\n\\nWHAT TODAY\\u2019S MARKET RALLY MEANS FOR INVESTORS\\n\\nTuesday\\u2019s bounce wasn\\u2019t just a technical recovery. It was laced with a growing narrative that India, for all its vulnerabilities, is increasingly being viewed as a safe harbour in turbulent global waters.\\n\\n\\\"Indian equities are relatively better positioned right now,\\u201d said Gary Dugan, CEO of The Global CIO Office. \\u201cThere\\u2019s good domestic growth, the market isn\\u2019t as exposed to export shocks, and we are seeing interest shift toward India as a structural China-plus-one play.\\\"\\n\\nThe contrast with China is hard to miss. While Beijing has dug in for a retaliatory fight in response to Washington\\u2019s fresh wave of tariffs, New Delhi has kept its tone diplomatic, quietly working behind the scenes toward a provisional deal.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThat conciliatory stance is paying dividends, at least in the eyes of foreign investors who are beginning to see India as a more stable node in the fractured global supply chain.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the US president\\u2019s latest hint at pausing future tariffs gave the markets exactly the breather they were waiting for. Volatility, which spiked alarmingly in early April, cooled off dramatically, lending further confidence to risk-takers.\\n\\nToday's rally was broad-based and across sectors. Heavyweights such as Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, SBI and Bharti Airtel all surged. Key sectors, including autos, banks, real estate, metals and financials, led from the front.a\\n\\nSTART OF A FRESH BULL RUN?\\n\\nStill, not everyone is rushing to call this the start of a new bull run.\\n\\n\\u201cThe S&P 500 is up 9% from its April lows. Nifty has barely risen 3%. We\\u2019re still playing catch-up,\\u201d said Dr VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services. \\u201cThe short-covering we\\u2019re seeing could fuel further gains, but the uncertainty around Trump\\u2019s trade moves hasn\\u2019t vanished. Sectoral tariffs are likely next, and that could hurt pharmaceuticals in particular.\\u201d\\n\\nHis advice is to stay with stocks rooted in domestic demand. Financials, telecom, hospitality, aviation and healthcare are sectors with earnings visibility and relatively low global exposure.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nMarket watchers agree that the India VIX may have cooled, but it's still hovering 46% above its pre-selloff levels. \\u201cRisk appetite remains fragile,\\u201d said Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit. \\u201cUnless volatility drops meaningfully, pushing past 23,000 on the Nifty may prove difficult. A breakout to 23,400 or even 24,000 needs a big global trigger and calm nerves.\\u201d\\n\\nFor now, the message from the Street is clear. The Dalal Street rally has legs, but it\\u2019s jogging on a tightrope. Investors would do well to resist the urge to chase momentum blindly. Be selective, not aggressive. Stick with quality. The bulls may be back, but so are the risks.\\n\\nPublished By: Koustav Das Published On: Apr 15, 2025\\n\\nTune In\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"After Harvard University rejected the Trump administration's demands to limit campus activism, former US President Barack Obama praised the university for setting an example for other higher education institutions.\\n\\nOn Friday, US President Donald Trump wrote to Harvard demanding the university audit views on diversity on campus and stop recognising certain student clubs. In response, University President Alan Garber wrote in a letter to the Harvard community on Monday, \\\"No government-regardless of which party is in power-should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.\\\"\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nCommending Harvard for defying what he described as the government's \\\"ham-handed\\\" attempt to stifle academic freedom, Obama posted on X, \\\"Harvard has set an example for other higher-ed institutions - rejecting an unlawful and ham-handed attempt to stifle academic freedom, while taking concrete steps to make sure all students at Harvard can benefit from an environment of intellectual inquiry, rigorous debate and mutual respect. Let's hope other institutions follow suit.\\\"\\n\\nJust hours after Harvard's rejection of the demands - which called for broad institutional reforms, changes to admissions policies, or risk losing $9 billion in grants and contracts - the US government announced it would freeze more than $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts to the university.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nColumbia University was the first to be targeted by the Trump administration, ultimately agreeing to the demands under the threat of massive funding cuts. The administration has also paused federal funding for the University of Pennsylvania, Brown, Princeton, Cornell, and Northwestern.\\n\\nTrump's administration has increasingly used the extraordinary tactic of withholding federal funds to pressure academic institutions to align with its political agenda and influence campus policies. The administration has argued that universities allowed antisemitism to go unchecked during last year's campus protests against Israel's war in Gaza.\\n\\nGarber stated that Harvard has already enacted extensive reforms to address antisemitism. He argued that many of the government's demands are unrelated to antisemitism and instead aim to regulate the \\\"intellectual conditions\\\" at the university.\\n\\nGarber said that withholding federal funding from Harvard, one of the nation's top research universities in science and medicine, risks not only the health and well-being of millions of individuals but also the economic security and vitality of our nation. He also claimed the action violates the university's First Amendment rights and exceeds the government's authority under Title VI, which prohibits discrimination based on race, colour, or national origin.\\n\\nAmong the government's demands were requirements that Harvard implement \\\"merit-based\\\" admissions and hiring policies, conduct an audit of students, faculty, and leadership on their views about diversity, and ban face masks on campus-an apparent move against pro-Palestinian protesters. The administration also called for a ban on face masks at Harvard - an apparent target of pro-Palestinian campus protesters - and pressured the university to stop recognising or funding \\\"any student group or club that endorses or promotes criminal activity, illegal violence, or illegal harassment.\\\"\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nIn response, the federal antisemitism task force said Monday that Harvard's defiance \\\"reinforces the troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation's most prestigious universities and colleges-that federal investment does not come with the responsibility to uphold civil rights laws.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The disruption of learning that has plagued campuses in recent years is unacceptable. The harassment of Jewish students is intolerable.\\\"\\n\\nTrump has promised a more aggressive approach to combatting antisemitism on campus, accusing President Joe Biden of being too lenient. His administration has launched new investigations, and in some cases, detained and deported foreign students involved in pro-Palestinian protests.\\n\\nThe Trump administration's actions prompted a group of Harvard alumni to write to university leadership, urging them to \\\"legally contest and refuse to comply with unlawful demands that threaten academic freedom and university self-governance.\\\"\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n\\\"Harvard stood up today for the integrity, values, and freedoms that serve as the foundation of higher education,\\\" said Anurima Bhargava, one of the alumni behind the letter. \\\"Harvard reminded the world that learning, innovation and transformative growth will not yield to bullying and authoritarian whims.\\\"\\n\\nThe government's pressure on Harvard also sparked a protest over the weekend from the campus community and residents of Cambridge and a lawsuit from the American Association of University Professors on Friday challenging the cuts.\\n\\nIn the lawsuit, plaintiffs argue that the Trump administration failed to follow the procedures required under Title VI before initiating cuts, including the obligation to notify both the university and Congress.\\n\\n\\\"These sweeping yet indeterminate demands are not remedies targeting the causes of any determination of noncompliance with federal law,\\\" the plaintiffs wrote. \\\"Instead, they overtly seek to impose political views and policy preferences advanced by the Trump administration, and to commit the university to punishing disfavoured speech.\\\"\\n\\n(With inputs from AP)\\n\\nPublished By: Anupriya Thakur Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

The CSK captain did not appear to be at his physical best on Monday, April 14, despite delivering an all-round performance that helped end the team's five-match losing streak.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nDhoni showed signs of discomfort even while keeping wickets. After pulling off a magical run-out of Abdul Samad, he was visibly struggling to maintain his balance. Nevertheless, he walked out to bat when Super Kings required more than 10 runs per over in the final five overs of the chase. He went on to smash 26 off just 11 deliveries in a match-winning partnership with Shivam Dube. Dhoni relied heavily on big shots, avoiding quick singles and steering clear of pushing for extra runs between the wickets.\\n\\nLater, he was later seen limping as he descended the stairs of the dressing room for post-match duties. In fact, Dhoni appeared unable to walk freely as he made his way to collect the Player of the Match award - his first such honour in the IPL in seven years.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nIn a more concerning video that has since gone viral on social media, Dhoni was spotted limping again while entering the team hotel in Lucknow on Monday. However, he was not wearing a knee brace or cap when stepping off the team bus.\\n\\nThala Dhoni limping , Hopefully not a serious one pic.twitter.com/cYfPOpWARG\\u2014 Chakri Dhoni (@ChakriDhonii) April 15, 2025\\n\\nWhile it is no secret that Dhoni has been managing a troublesome knee over the past few years, Monday marked the first time this season that he was seen in visible discomfort.\\n\\nHowever, neither MS Dhoni nor the Chennai Super Kings management have expressed any concerns over a potential injury. CSK\\u2019s bowling coach, Eric Simons, did not address the matter when speaking to the press following the team\\u2019s victory in Lucknow.\\n\\nDhoni remained calm and composed on the field after winning the toss and choosing to field against a power-packed Lucknow Super Giants batting line-up. He was sharp behind the stumps and executed a sensational run-out with a direct hit from well behind the wicket, catching the batter short at the non-striker's end. He was also tested by Matheesha Pathirana, who sent down several deliveries straying down the leg side, keeping Dhoni on his toes.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThanks to Dhoni's excellent glovework and a disciplined bowling performance, Super Kings restricted the Super Giants to 166 runs in their allotted 20 overs.\\n\\nDhoni has been managing a wobbly knee throughout his recent IPL stints. During the 2023 season, he led CSK to their fifth IPL title while playing through pain, before undergoing surgery in Mumbai after the tournament.\\n\\nHowever, knee concerns resurfaced in 2024. Despite the recurring issues, Dhoni managed to play all 14 matches for CSK last season.\\n\\nIn a recent podcast, Dhoni said that his future in the IPL would depend on how his body responds at the end of each season.\\n\\nCSK fans will be hoping the veteran wicketkeeper recovers in time and regains full fitness ahead of their high-stakes clash against the Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede Stadium on Sunday, 20 April. The Super Kings have a five-day break before that marquee fixture.\\n\\nPublished By: Akshay Ramesh Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

India play a 5-match series against England in the months of June, July, and August. That series finishes on August 4. However, as seen in recent times, there has been more and more segregation between the teams in all formats of the game. There will be very few players who might be carried to the T20I side from the Test team.\\n\\nIndia's home season begins in the month of October with West Indies and South Africa travelling to India in the winters. India's home season will begin with a two-match Test series against the West Indies on October 2 after which they will take on South Africa in two Tests, three ODis and five T20Is in November-December.\\n\\nIndia will play three ODIs and five T20Is in Australia between the two home series. Cricket Australia, earlier this month, announced the schedule for the series, with ODIs starting on October 19 and the T20Is starting on October 29.\",\n",

These students spotted at least nine questionable answers in the JEE Main 2025 April 9 paper.\\n\\nThe errors span all three core subjects: four in physics, three in chemistry, and two in maths. Students say the problems aren\\u2019t just tricky questions -- they are factually incorrect and could seriously affect scores.\\n\\nTop coaching centres and subject experts backed the students\\u2019 claims, saying the problems show poor quality control by NTA for such a major national exam.\\n\\nEducator and commentator @kamath_pramod posted on X, \\u201cIt\\u2019s unacceptable that such basic mistakes are creeping into national-level exams.\\u201d He highlighted one modern physics question from the April 7 AM shift, calling it \\u201cconceptually flawed.\\u201d\\n\\nHe added, \\u201cIf NTA doesn\\u2019t correct this, it\\u2019s an injustice to lakhs of students.\\u201d\\n\\nAnother user on X put it bluntly: \\u201cTragedy of errors \\u2013 JEE Main response sheet is different from what students actually filled in many cases + lot of answers wrongly given by NTA.\\u201d\\n\\nRESPONSE SHEET MESS ADDS TO STUDENTS\\u2019 WORRIES\\n\\nThe issue goes beyond just the answer key. Several candidates and their parents reported major errors in the response sheets shared by NTA. Some students said their selected answers were wrongly recorded, while others found the sheets showing blank responses.\\n\\nPramod Kamath, who is also a parent, posted on social media, \\u201cIndeed my daughter attempted 71 questions. During submission it showed 71 questions attempted & now in the response sheet it is showing all questions as unanswered! Shocking! NTA is playing with the future of children. No response on email!\\u201d\\n\\nAnother student, who appeared for the April 3 shift 2 exam, said he had selected the first option for a physics question, but the response sheet now shows the second option.\\n\\nOne parent, Rekha Verma, wrote on X, \\u201cMy daughter has attempted 50 questions but it is showing 48. So many questions showing the wrong attempt. We will mail to NTA for this blunder. I am very worried for her.\\u201d\\n\\nA different user added, \\u201cActually we are also experiencing similar issue on answer sheet shared by NTA. We request to the management to review and publish error free results.\\u201d\\n\\nA mother whose daughter regularly scored between 180-190 in practice tests said her child\\u2019s answer sheet now shows several incorrect options that were not marked by her.\\n\\n'BLANK' ANSWERS AND UNRESPONSIVE NTA\\n\\nSome students even reported that the system simply didn\\u2019t record their answers at all. One X user shared, \\u201cAnswers submitted were not considered and shows up as \\u2018blank\\u2019. An email to NTA went unanswered. Ridiculous that they conduct an exam for such premier institutes and are least bothered about the transparency. Who will guard the guards?\\u201d\\n\\nIn another post, someone said the same issue occurred with his sister\\u2019s paper -- one question was missing her chosen answer entirely.\\n\\nOPPOSITION LEADERS JOIN IN, QUESTION NTA\\u2019S CREDIBILITY\\n\\nAs reports of errors spread, political leaders also stepped in, questioning the NTA\\u2019s ability to conduct high-stakes exams.\\n\\nReferring to the TOI report, Congress leader Supriya Shrinate posted in Hindi on X:\\n\\n\\u201cThe NTA is already facing questions over the conduct of competitive exams \\u2013 last year's CUET-UG, NEET-UG answer sheets also had errors. Is the NTA capable of conducting these exams? Was the tension of unemployment and paper leaks not enough for our youth that now they have to deal with a weak NTA as well?\\u201d\\n\\nWHAT NEXT FOR STUDENTS?\\n\\nThe window to challenge the JEE Main 2025 Session 2 answer key has already closed, and the results are expected by April 17. But with so many discrepancies raised -- from factual errors to technical glitches -- students are demanding that the NTA drop the flawed questions or award bonus marks.\\n\\nSo far, there\\u2019s been no official response from the agency. With lakhs of students depending on this exam to secure a place in top engineering colleges, the silence is only fuelling anxiety.\\n\\nAll eyes are now on the NTA -- will it admit to the issues and act, or leave students to bear the consequences?\\n\\nPublished By: Roshni Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"There's something about one-shot scenes that brings an inherent excitement, and a sense of unparalleled immersiveness to cinema. A section of the audience couldn't have been more aware of this camera technique until Netflix's 'Adolescence' broke the barriers of storytelling. It was raw, well-coordinated, demanding and so precise that it provided an extra edge to the story. But, this is not the first time that the Indian audience and filmmakers have woken up to this kind of camera movement technique.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nSeveral OTT shows and films have done the same over the years in various scenes to give the audience a taste of something different, something that sets them apart. Have a look at a few here:\\n\\n1. Ship of Theseus (2012): The mother is admitted scene (7 minutes)\\n\\nSohum Shah\\u2019s 'Ship of Theseus' wasn\\u2019t just a philosophical piece, it was also technically brilliant. One of its most powerful scenes, where a mother is admitted to the hospital, plays out in a 7-minute continuous take. The shot captures the chaotic yet intimate emotions of a man navigating bureaucracy, morality, and grief \\u2014 all in one breathless sequence that never cuts away.\\n\\n2. Viduthalai (2023): The train scene (8 minutes)\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nVetri Maaran\\u2019s 'Vidhuthalai' delivers an edge-of-the-seat 8-minute sequence involving a train and a tense, escalating situation. Shot in a single take, the scene is a technical surprise, immersing the audience right into the unfolding drama with no moment to pause or look away. The fluid camera work and the unflinching performances make it one of the most gripping one-take sequences in Indian cinema.\\n\\n3. The Family Man (2019): Hospital assault sequence (13 minutes)\\n\\nShot in a real, functioning hospital with actual heart patients in the ward, this 13-minute one-take sequence is one of 'The Family Man's' most intense moments. Filmed from the villains' perspective, it builds a wave of dread as danger creeps toward unsuspecting characters.\\n\\nInterestingly, despite having just two nights at the expensive location \\u2014 one for rehearsal, and another for shooting - co-director DK refused to break the shot. And the team pulled it off in a single go. It can definitely be seen as a masterclass in coordination, tension, and bold storytelling.\\n\\n4. Gangs of Wasseypur (2012): Home shootout (7 minutes)\\n\\nAnurag Kashyap\\u2019s 'Gangs of Wasseypur' is known for its gritty realism, and one of its standout moments is a seven-minute one-take sequence capturing a frantic shootout. The camera doesn't flinch and follows Faizal Khan's (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) character running through narrow alleys, ducking bullets, and raging through the violence. It's tense, raw, with a slight punch of humour making it deeply cinematic \\u2014 a moment that stays with you long after the film ends.\\n\\n5. Dil Dhadakne Do (2015): The Gallan Goodiyan song (4 minutes)\\n\\nNot all one-take scenes are about action or intensity. Sometimes, it\\u2019s about capturing joy. The 'Gallan Goodiyan' song from 'Dil Dhadakne Do' is a vibrant 4-minute single-shot celebration, following the characters around a cruise ship dinner party as they sing and dance. It\\u2019s also something which can be seen as choreography-triumph, with a spontaneous and infectious sense of pure joy.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n6. CID - The Inheritance (111 minutes)\\n\\nOn November 7, 2004, Sony TV ran a special episode of CID, titled 'The Inheritance', without any single cut. BP Singh, the director of the show, wanted to make an entry into the Guinness Book of World Records and Limca Book of Records, and therefore, he decided to shoot a 111-minute-long episode of the popular show using the one-shot technique, which later went into the pages of history. It didn't just create a record for the longest shot episode, but also for the longest shot to be filmed ever.\\n\\nThe one-shot sequences are demanding. They demand perfection, a solid hold on one's craft, and the best kind of coordination between artistes, cinematographers, directors and the audience. At the end of it all lies audacity, and a spirit to experiment. Indian cinema and the OTT space got to stay on the hustle.\\n\\nPublished By: Vineeta Kumar Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"title\": \"Union Minister says new Waqf Act will not let Munambam-like issue to happen\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"Union minister Kiren Rijiju defended the recent amendments to the Waqf Act, arguing the changes were necessary to prevent arbitrary land grabs and address long-standing grievances.\\n\\nSpeaking in Kerala on Tuesday, Union Minister Kiren Rijiju said the move was vital to protecting people\\u2019s rights over their land. \\u201cLand is the most precious thing. Many countries go to war for it. We must protect every inch for its rightful owner,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nRijiju criticised the past provisions of the Act for giving \\u201cunprecedented powers\\u201d to Waqf boards, which he alleged had been misused in several cases\\u2014including the Munambam land dispute in Kerala.\\n\\nThe Munambam case, where the Kerala Waqf Board declared 404 acres as Waqf property, allegedly depriving over 600 fishermen of ownership, was a focal point of his address. Rijiju called it a \\u201ctragedy\\u201d and promised justice. \\u201cThe government will ensure such cases do not happen again,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nHe said that as part of the reforms, the Centre has struck down Section 40 of the Act, which had empowered Waqf Boards to unilaterally declare any land as Waqf. \\u201cNo authority should have uncontrolled power. All future surveys will be led by the District Collector and based strictly on government records,\\u201d Rijiju said.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nHe flagged the scale of unchecked claims, stating that over 18 lakh properties were declared as Waqf between 2013 and 2025. \\u201cIf we don\\u2019t act now, people will continue losing ownership. Once declared Waqf, it\\u2019s irreversible\\u2014that cannot continue,\\u201d he said.\\n\\nThe amended law now makes a registered Waqf deed mandatory for any claim. It also bars the declaration of disputed or sub-judice land as Waqf. Another major change is the removal of the \\u201cWaqf by user\\u201d clause, which allowed claims without documentation. \\u201cThat was dangerous,\\u201d Rijiju said.\\n\\nThe Minister also announced that all state Waqf boards and tribunals will be reconstituted. Explaining the legal premise, he said, \\u201cIf a Waqif dedicates a property, then it becomes Waqf\\u2014but it cannot be transferred. That\\u2019s the core of the Munambam issue. It can be challenged.\\u201d\\n\\nTaking aim at the Congress, Rijiju said the 2013 amendments made by the party allowed sweeping Waqf claims. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve now brought in strict safeguards,\\u201d he said. The new law also allows appeals against Waqf Tribunal decisions in High Courts and restructures board and tribunal composition.\\n\\nRijiju said he would visit Munambam later that evening to meet affected residents. Referring to a case involving Mohammad Siddiqui Sait, he said, \\u201cOnce land is transferred, it is no longer Waqf. The High Court ruling can be challenged in the Supreme Court.\\u201d\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nHe urged the Kerala government to act swiftly. \\u201cWe\\u2019re in a federal setup. We\\u2019ve made the law, now the state must implement it. The Centre will provide all legal and administrative support to help people reclaim their land.\\u201d\\n\\nAddressing concerns that the amendments target Muslims, Rijiju said, \\u201cThere\\u2019s a false campaign claiming we\\u2019re anti-Muslim. In fact, crores of poor Muslims have also been denied Waqf benefits. The majority get nothing. This law is not against any community.\\u201d\\n\\nHe also flagged other alleged overreaches. \\u201cIn some instances, Waqf Boards have unilaterally declared entire villages and even Parliament as Waqf property. One person even claimed a third of Delhi. These kinds of unlimited claims will no longer be allowed. Our position is very clear.\\u201d\\n\\nPublished By: Afreen Published On: Apr 15, 2025\\n\\nTune In\",\n",

      "        \"title\": \"Bat sizes under scanner: Why BCCI introduced in-match checks in IPL 2025\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"Before the 2025 IPL season, had you ever seen umpires checking the size of bats out in the middle? Probably not. In a first, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has instructed on-field umpires to carry out regular bat size checks during matches in this season of the premier T20 league.\\n\\nThe practice of assessing bat sizes isn't new. Previously, players would submit their bats for inspection either before a match or on its eve-usually inside the dressing room. Those checks were conducted away from public view.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nIn a bid to step up vigilance, on-field umpires have now been directed to use the 'home-shaped bat gauge' during the game itself. According to The Indian Express, every batter must pass the gauge test before taking guard.\\n\\nDuring the first two weeks of April, several batters-including Hardik Pandya, Phil Salt, and Shimron Hetmyer -- had their bats checked by the umpires on the field. To the BCCI's satisfaction, none of the bats examined exceeded the dimensions outlined in the IPL's official rule book. The regulations specify that the bat's width must not exceed 4.25 inches, and it must pass freely through the gauge.\\n\\n\\\"The blade of the bat must not exceed the following dimensions: Width: 4.25 in / 10.8 cm, Depth: 2.64 in / 6.7 cm, Edge: 1.56 in / 4.0 cm. Moreover, it must be able to pass through a bat gauge,\\\" the rule states.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nWhat prompted this change? Were there any violations?\\n\\n\\\"We always conducted bat checks in the dressing room before the start of the innings. Players would hand over their bats and the check would be completed there,\\\" a former umpire told news agency PTI.\\n\\n\\\"Now the question is: did any player submit one bat for inspection and use a different one on the field? If that's the case, then this new protocol is certainly justified. Players often carry multiple bats. While the weight may vary, the height, width (face of the bat), depth (middle of the blade), and edge width must remain within the ICC's prescribed limits,\\\" the umpire added.\\n\\nAccording to The Indian Express, there have been a few instances where players were found using oversized bats. Those players were let off with warnings, but the BCCI has now opted for stricter enforcement. In today's power-hitting era of T20 cricket, concerns about the bat increasingly overshadowing the ball are growing louder.\\n\\nIPL chairman Arun Dhumal, speaking to the newspaper, said the new checks aim to uphold the spirit of the game.\\n\\nTo put things in perspective, in the first three weeks of IPL 2024, teams posted 10 scores in excess of 200. That number has nearly doubled in 2025, with 19 such totals already recorded. Last season, SunRisers Hyderabad led the big-hitting charge, breaching the 260-run mark three times. They also posted the highest team total in IPL history: 287 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThis year, SRH continued their explosive form, posting 286 in their opening game against Rajasthan Royals-just one run short of their own record.\\n\\nBOWLERS VOICE CONCERNS\\n\\nA number of bowlers, including R Ashwin, Kagiso Rabada, and Shardul Thakur, have raised concerns about the increasing imbalance between bat and ball in IPL 2025. The Impact Player rule, which allows teams to effectively play with an extra batter or bowler, has further tilted the game in favour of the batters.\\n\\n\\\"You say bowlers are becoming defensive. I want to speak about that,\\\" Ashwin said on his YouTube channel. \\\"I think bowlers will soon need personal psychologists. I genuinely mean it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let's say bowlers are becoming defensive-fine. But in several cases, bowling has genuinely become impossible,\\\" he added.\\n\\nIn a move to support bowlers, the BCCI has lifted the ban on the use of saliva to assist with reverse swing. Saliva had been prohibited by the ICC during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nAdditionally, to counter the dew factor, the BCCI has approved the use of a second ball during the second innings of IPL 2025 matches.\\n\\nPublished By: Akshay Ramesh Published On: Apr 15, 2025\\n\\nTune In\",\n",

While Karnataka took the top spot, West Bengal came last among the 18 large and mid-sized states.\\n\\nThe performance of states on the four pillars of justice -- police, prisons, judiciary and legal aid -- was considered for the ranking. The report highlights areas where states are making headway or falling behind in the process of fighting crime and in justice delivery.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nAll the top spots in the large and mid-sized category were taken by southern states -- Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. West Bengal came at the bottom of the table, followed by Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and Rajasthan.\\n\\nWhile Karnataka scored 6.78 out of 10, West Bengal's overall score was 3.63. It was the second last state and slipped to the bottom in this year's rankings.\\n\\nTelangana, which ranked 11th in the last survey, jumped to the third spot in the fourth edition of India Justice Report.\\n\\nAmong the seven small states, Sikkim was the best-performer, while Goa was the laggard.\\n\\nBihar showed the most improvement in the category of police from 2022 to 2025.\\n\\n\\\"Nationally, the police-population ratio remained stagnant at 155 police personnel per 100,000 population, significantly below the sanctioned strength of 197.5,\\\" the report said.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nBihar had the worst police-to-population ratio, at just 81 police per lakh people.\\n\\nBetween 2022 and 2025, Rajasthan, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh improved the most on judicial indicators, according to the India Justice Report 2025.\\n\\nOdisha and Jharkhand improved the most on the indicators concerning prisons.\\n\\n\\\"Over the last decade, prison populations have surged by nearly 50%. The proportion of undertrials --people awaiting completion of an investigation or trial -- has escalated from 66% to 76%,\\\" the 2025 report said.\\n\\nIn terms of providing legal aid, Haryana has made the most improvement since the last edition of the report published in 2022.\\n\\nThe report highlights that a lion's share of the money allotted for budgets in the criminal-justice system goes into paying salaries, with very little left for infrastructure development. This directly impacts training, which results in the quality of policing and judicial services.\\n\\nIn the foreword to the report, former Supreme Court judge Sanjay Kishan Kaul writes that for reforms to take place, \\\"Leaders within the judiciary, government, and civil services must be willing to champion change, take risks, and challenge the status quo.\\\"\\n\\nHe also emphasises the need for public pressure to reform the justice system, saying \\\"it must become a societal demand\\\".\\n\\nPublished By: Sushim Mukul Published On: Apr 15, 2025\\n\\nTune In\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has said that visas and immigration statuses for nine of its international students and researchers were revoked without any prior warning or explanation. The move comes as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration as well as an attempt to temper the activism that they perceive as hostile to conservatives.\\n\\nTill now, the US government has cancelled the visas of nearly 530 students, faculty and researchers across 88 colleges and universities, as per a report by CBS.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nIn a letter to the MIT community, university president Sally Kornbluth on Monday expressed concern over the recent government actions that, she said, threatened not just MIT's operations but also the country's ability to attract top global talent and maintain scientific leadership.\\n\\n\\\"Since April 4, nine members of our community - students, recent graduates and postdocs - have had their visas and immigration status unexpectedly revoked,\\\" Kornbluth wrote, adding that the lack of any official communication or rationale from the government was alarming.\\n\\nWhile the institute was not directly involved in the lawsuit filed by one affected student, it says it remained \\\"extremely concerned\\\" about the broader implications.\\n\\n\\\"These actions are interfering with the normal functioning of MIT,\\\" Kornbluth said. \\\"They diminish our ability both to serve the nation and to attract the world's finest talent.\\\"\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThe visa revocations come alongside a separate federal policy shift that prompted MIT and several other top-tier universities, including Princeton, Caltech and the University of Illinois, to sue the Department of Energy (DOE) in a Boston federal court.\\n\\nThe lawsuit challenges the administration's sudden decision to cap indirect research cost reimbursements at 15 per cent, a move that could result in hundreds of millions in lost funding for academic institutions engaged in high-stakes research.\\n\\nIndirect costs cover vital infrastructure and services that support scientific research but aren't tied to a specific project. These include safety protocols, facility maintenance, data storage and compliance systems. MIT noted that nearly 1,000 members of its community rely on DOE grants, which were now at risk.\\n\\nIn her letter, Kornbluth said the cuts would \\\"devastate scientific research at America’s universities\\\" and hurt the country's long-term innovation prospects.\\n\\n\\\"To find those rare people (with exceptional talent), we open ourselves to talent from every corner of the US and from around the globe,\\\" she wrote. \\\"The threat of unexpected visa revocations will make it less likely that top talent from around the world will come to the US - and that will damage American competitiveness and scientific leadership for years to come.\\\"\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThe Department of Energy announced the new cap on April 11, saying it would make federal research spending more transparent and efficient. But universities say the change is unfair and disruptive, especially since many had already agreed on much higher reimbursement rates. For example, the University of Michigan could lose over USD 30 million because of this new rule.\\n\\nThis is the second time in recent months that universities have been forced into court over similar actions. Earlier this year, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) imposed a similar funding cap, which was then challenged in court. A federal judge issued a permanent injunction halting those cuts while the case proceeds.\\n\\nThe government is using funds to negotiate with the universities and ensure they comply with the directives. The punishment for defiance is freezing of funding, like with Harvard University.\\n\\nThe Trump administration on Monday froze approximately USD 2.3 billion in federal funding to Harvard University after the Ivy League school refused to comply with a list of White House demands to limit activism on campus and dismantle its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes.\\n\\nThe freeze includes USD 2.2 billion in grants and USD 60 million in federal contracts, according to the department's task force on combating antisemitism, which said Harvard's resistance reflected \\\"the troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation's most prestigious universities\\\".\\n\\n(With inputs from Reuters)\",\n",

This effectively bars the opposition from highlighting any shortcomings or raising objections at the very outset.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThe committee formed by MK Stalin, which will also include former bureaucrats Ashok Shetty and Mu Nagarajan, will submit its interim report by January 2026 and the final report, containing detailed recommendations, is expected to be submitted within two years.\\n\\nThe committee has also been assigned the responsibility of suggesting ways to reclaim subject of governance and policy-making that were originally under the sole jurisdiction of state governments but are now jointly administered by the state and Centre.\\n\\nWhile making the announcement, Stalin said that his aim was to protect the rights of all states, including Tamil Nadu.\\n\\nFurther, in his address in the state Assembly, Stalin renewed his sharp criticism of the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) and the National Education Policy (NEP). Accusing the Centre of linguistic imposition, the Chief Minister said the NEP is being used as a tool to promote Hindi across the country.\\n\\nHe also reiterated his allegation that the Union government has withheld Rs 2,500 crore in funds as a punitive measure for Tamil Nadu’s continued refusal to implement the NEP.\\n\\n\\\"We have lost many students due to the NEET exam. We have continuously opposed the NEET exam. In the name of the triple language policy, the Union Government is trying to impose Hindi in Tamil Nadu. Since we have denied NEP, Rs 2500 cr to the state has not been released by the Union government,\\\" news agency ANI quoted him as saying.\\n\\nPublished By: sharangee Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"title\": \"Bat sizes under scanner: Why BCCI introduced in-match checks in IPL 2025\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"Before the 2025 IPL season, had you ever seen umpires checking the size of bats out in the middle? Probably not. In a first, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has instructed on-field umpires to carry out regular bat size checks during matches in this season of the premier T20 league.\\n\\nThe practice of assessing bat sizes isn't new. Previously, players would submit their bats for inspection either before a match or on its eve-usually inside the dressing room. Those checks were conducted away from public view.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nIn a bid to step up vigilance, on-field umpires have now been directed to use the 'home-shaped bat gauge' during the game itself. According to The Indian Express, every batter must pass the gauge test before taking guard.\\n\\nDuring the first two weeks of April, several batters-including Hardik Pandya, Phil Salt, and Shimron Hetmyer -- had their bats checked by the umpires on the field. To the BCCI's satisfaction, none of the bats examined exceeded the dimensions outlined in the IPL's official rule book. The regulations specify that the bat's width must not exceed 4.25 inches, and it must pass freely through the gauge.\\n\\n\\\"The blade of the bat must not exceed the following dimensions: Width: 4.25 in / 10.8 cm, Depth: 2.64 in / 6.7 cm, Edge: 1.56 in / 4.0 cm. Moreover, it must be able to pass through a bat gauge,\\\" the rule states.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nWhat prompted this change? Were there any violations?\\n\\n\\\"We always conducted bat checks in the dressing room before the start of the innings. Players would hand over their bats and the check would be completed there,\\\" a former umpire told news agency PTI.\\n\\n\\\"Now the question is: did any player submit one bat for inspection and use a different one on the field? If that's the case, then this new protocol is certainly justified. Players often carry multiple bats. While the weight may vary, the height, width (face of the bat), depth (middle of the blade), and edge width must remain within the ICC's prescribed limits,\\\" the umpire added.\\n\\nAccording to The Indian Express, there have been a few instances where players were found using oversized bats. Those players were let off with warnings, but the BCCI has now opted for stricter enforcement. In today's power-hitting era of T20 cricket, concerns about the bat increasingly overshadowing the ball are growing louder.\\n\\nIPL chairman Arun Dhumal, speaking to the newspaper, said the new checks aim to uphold the spirit of the game.\\n\\nTo put things in perspective, in the first three weeks of IPL 2024, teams posted 10 scores in excess of 200. That number has nearly doubled in 2025, with 19 such totals already recorded. Last season, SunRisers Hyderabad led the big-hitting charge, breaching the 260-run mark three times. They also posted the highest team total in IPL history: 287 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThis year, SRH continued their explosive form, posting 286 in their opening game against Rajasthan Royals-just one run short of their own record.\\n\\nBOWLERS VOICE CONCERNS\\n\\nA number of bowlers, including R Ashwin, Kagiso Rabada, and Shardul Thakur, have raised concerns about the increasing imbalance between bat and ball in IPL 2025. The Impact Player rule, which allows teams to effectively play with an extra batter or bowler, has further tilted the game in favour of the batters.\\n\\n\\\"You say bowlers are becoming defensive. I want to speak about that,\\\" Ashwin said on his YouTube channel. \\\"I think bowlers will soon need personal psychologists. I genuinely mean it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let's say bowlers are becoming defensive-fine. But in several cases, bowling has genuinely become impossible,\\\" he added.\\n\\nIn a move to support bowlers, the BCCI has lifted the ban on the use of saliva to assist with reverse swing. Saliva had been prohibited by the ICC during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nAdditionally, to counter the dew factor, the BCCI has approved the use of a second ball during the second innings of IPL 2025 matches.\\n\\nPublished By: Akshay Ramesh Published On: Apr 15, 2025\\n\\nTune In\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"It is not very common that you win the Indian Premier League and then do not get retained by the team. It must have hurt Shreyas Iyer that his white-ball credentials still got questioned after having a stunning ODI World Cup 2023 and then the IPL 2024. Iyer returned with his vengeance in the domestic season of 2024, raking in runs in all formats of the game. And then, who can forget the series against England and the Champions Trophy, where he was one of India’s best batters.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nHowever, the arc is not yet complete. Shreyas Iyer, now the captain of Punjab Kings – the second most expensive player in the history of IPL – will be up against his former side, KKR. Iyer has been in never-before-seen touch this season, hitting sixes from ball one – against both spin and pace.\\n\\nIyer's aggression and the will for revenge have rubbed off on the Punjab Kings side as well – a bunch of misfits – who are currently banded together by none other than Ricky Ponting, Iyer's former coach at the Delhi Capitals. Ponting and Iyer have combined to propel PBKS to a good start this season. Three wins from five games mean that they sit in 6th position on the points table, despite their epic thrashing against SunRisers Hyderabad.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThe side will look to shake that off and make sure they put the foot on the pedal once again when they take on KKR at their home ground in Mullanpur.\\n\\nPBKS' Big Worry\\n\\nPunjab Kings all-rounder, one of Ricky Ponting's favourite players – Glenn Maxwell – has not clicked at all this season. Maxwell has a little over 30 runs from five games and has only picked up three wickets this season. For commentator Simon Doull, that seems to be enough. Doull wants Punjab to try out Josh Inglis, who has been warming the benches despite a sensational Champions Trophy. Doull has also suggested that Punjab bring in Azmatullah Omarzai, who has the ability to bowl and bat in the middle phases.\\n\\nPunjab will most certainly miss Lockie Ferguson in the line-up, who has been all but ruled out of the season, and replacing him will be a big task for the team.\\n\\nPBKS vs KKR: Head-to-Head\\n\\nHistorically, KKR lead the rivalry 21-12 in the IPL. However, that seems to be shifting over the last few years. In current form, PBKS definitely have the firepower to beat KKR.\\n\\nPBKS vs KKR: Team News\\n\\nLockie Ferguson has been ruled out due to injury. PBKS have multiple options in their side to replace the fast bowler. In terms of pure bowling options, they have Kuldeep Sen and Vijaykumar Vyshak. They can also opt to play Azmatullah Omarzai in his place.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nKKR, on the other hand, might opt for Spencer Johnson in this encounter in place of Moeen Ali. Spencer's pace might rattle the ultra-aggressive batters in the Punjab side.\\n\\nPBKS vs KKR: Predicted Playing XIs\\n\\nPBKS Predicted XI\\n\\nPriyansh Arya, Prabhsimran Singh (wk), Shreyas Iyer (c), Marcus Stoinis, Nehal Wadhera, Glenn Maxwell/Azmatullah Omarzai, Shashank Singh, Marco Jansen, Arshdeep Singh, Yuzvendra Chahal, Vyshak Vijaykumar\\n\\nImpact Sub: Glenn Maxwell\\n\\nKKR Predicted XI\\n\\nSunil Narine, Quinton de Kock (wk), Ajinkya Rahane (c), Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Venkatesh Iyer, Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Ramandeep Singh, Harshit Rana, Spencer Johnson, Varun Chakaravarthy\\n\\nImpact Sub: Vaibhav Arora\\n\\nIPL 2025: Top Fantasy Picks\\n\\nKKR\\n\\nSunil Narine\\n\\nVenkatesh Iyer\\n\\nVarun Chakaravarthy\\n\\nSpencer Johnson\\n\\nQuinton de Kock\\n\\nPBKS\\n\\nShreyas Iyer\\n\\nArshdeep Singh\\n\\nPriyansh Arya\\n\\nMarco Jansen\\n\\nVyshak Vijaykumar\\n\\nPBKS vs KKR: Pitch and Weather Conditions\\n\\nIt is expected to be hot in Chandigarh now that the rains have subsided in the northern part of the country.

      "        \"text\": \"India is expected to receive above-normal monsoon rainfall in 2025, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasting seasonal rainfall at 105% of the long-period average. The projection comes with a model error margin of 5%, officials announced on Tuesday.\\n\\nThe southwest monsoon typically begins its advance over Kerala around June 1 and withdraws by mid-September. The projected above-average rainfall could provide a much-needed lift to the agricultural sector, the Ministry of Earth Sciences said.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nAccording to the IMD, this year’s forecast suggests that most parts of the country are likely to benefit from favourable rainfall conditions, with the exception of a few regions. Rainfall is expected to be below normal in Ladakh, the Northeast, and Tamil Nadu during the four-month monsoon season.\\n\\nThe IMD defines normal rainfall as between 96% and 104% of the 50-year average of 87 cm (about 35 inches). Any amount above this range is considered “above normal.”\\n\\nThe officials said all key climate factors — including the El Nino and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) — are currently in a neutral phase. These neutral conditions are considered favourable for a healthy monsoon.\\n\\nEl Nino refers to a climate pattern where the surface waters of the central and eastern Pacific Ocean become warmer than usual, often leading to weaker monsoons and less rainfall in India. The Indian Ocean Dipole refers to a weather phenomenon in the Indian Ocean where the difference in sea surface temperatures between the western and eastern parts affects rainfall. A positive IOD usually brings more rain to India, while a negative IOD can reduce it.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nApart from these, another positive indicator this year is the reduced snow cover over Eurasia and the Himalayan region. Historically, lower snow cover in these areas has been associated with stronger monsoon rainfall in India.\\n\\nWith favourable ocean and atmospheric conditions in place, this year’s monsoon is expected to be above-average and provide much-needed relief to the agricultural sector.\\n\\nPublished By: sharangee Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"Even as Chennai Super Kings fans dream of a comeback from the five-time champions following a rocky start to their IPL 2025 campaign, some worrying visuals have emerged of MS Dhoni limping after his heroics against the Lucknow Super Giants. The CSK captain did not appear to be at his physical best on Monday, April 14, despite delivering an all-round performance that helped end the team's five-match losing streak.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nDhoni showed signs of discomfort even while keeping wickets. After pulling off a magical run-out of Abdul Samad, he was visibly struggling to maintain his balance. Nevertheless, he walked out to bat when Super Kings required more than 10 runs per over in the final five overs of the chase. He went on to smash 26 off just 11 deliveries in a match-winning partnership with Shivam Dube. Dhoni relied heavily on big shots, avoiding quick singles and steering clear of pushing for extra runs between the wickets.\\n\\nLater, he was later seen limping as he descended the stairs of the dressing room for post-match duties. In fact, Dhoni appeared unable to walk freely as he made his way to collect the Player of the Match award - his first such honour in the IPL in seven years.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nIn a more concerning video that has since gone viral on social media, Dhoni was spotted limping again while entering the team hotel in Lucknow on Monday. However, he was not wearing a knee brace or cap when stepping off the team bus.\\n\\nThala Dhoni limping , Hopefully not a serious one pic.twitter.com/cYfPOpWARG— Chakri Dhoni (@ChakriDhonii) April 15, 2025\\n\\nWhile it is no secret that Dhoni has been managing a troublesome knee over the past few years, Monday marked the first time this season that he was seen in visible discomfort.\\n\\nHowever, neither MS Dhoni nor the Chennai Super Kings management have expressed any concerns over a potential injury. CSK’s bowling coach, Eric Simons, did not address the matter when speaking to the press following the team’s victory in Lucknow.\\n\\nDhoni remained calm and composed on the field after winning the toss and choosing to field against a power-packed Lucknow Super Giants batting line-up. He was sharp behind the stumps and executed a sensational run-out with a direct hit from well behind the wicket, catching the batter short at the non-striker's end. He was also tested by Matheesha Pathirana, who sent down several deliveries straying down the leg side, keeping Dhoni on his toes.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThanks to Dhoni's excellent glovework and a disciplined bowling performance, Super Kings restricted the Super Giants to 166 runs in their allotted 20 overs.\\n\\nDhoni has been managing a wobbly knee throughout his recent IPL stints. During the 2023 season, he led CSK to their fifth IPL title while playing through pain, before undergoing surgery in Mumbai after the tournament.\\n\\nHowever, knee concerns resurfaced in 2024. Despite the recurring issues, Dhoni managed to play all 14 matches for CSK last season.\\n\\nIn a recent podcast, Dhoni said that his future in the IPL would depend on how his body responds at the end of each season.\\n\\nCSK fans will be hoping the veteran wicketkeeper recovers in time and regains full fitness ahead of their high-stakes clash against the Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede Stadium on Sunday, 20 April. The Super Kings have a five-day break before that marquee fixture.\\n\\nPublished By: Akshay Ramesh Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

The case against Modi is that he connived with PNB officials since 2011 to fraudulently raise letters of understanding (LoUs) without the mandatory collaterals and obtained foreign loans, ostensibly for importing pearls and diamonds to make jewellery. However, the money thus raised was used only to retire old debt, ultimately leading to an ‘ever-greening’ of loans.\\n\\n\\n\\nEver since the unravelling of the Nirav Modi scam, Choksi too came under the radar of investigating agencies, including the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED). Choksi is alleged to owe over Rs 6,000 crore to 34 Indian banks after raising loans in a manner similar to Modi. After the scam came to light in January 2018, Choksi fled to the Caribbean nation of Antigua and Barbuda, where he had taken citizenship.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn May 2021, Choksi surfaced in neighbouring Dominica, where he was detained for illegal entry. A team of CBI officials were flown to Dominica to bring Choksi back, but the move failed as Choksi was allowed by the Dominica High Court in July 2021 to travel back to Antigua to seek medical help.\\n\\n\\n\\nFollowing this, all proceedings against Choksi in Dominica were dropped. Media reports say Choksi had come to Belgium last year for treatment of cancer and had been in that country since.\\n\\n\\n\\nChoksi, who owned Gitanjali Gems, was one of the country’s most high profile jewellers. At its peak, Gitanjali Gems had 4,000 retail outlets and enjoyed a market share of over 50 per cent of the country’s organised jewellery market, with prominent brands, including Nakshatra and Gili.\\n\\n\\n\\nIndia and Belgium had a treaty on mutual extradition of fugitive criminals dating back to October 1901, when the former was under British rule. This has gone through several amendments. The two countries signed the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty in 2020 for better cooperation on fugitives.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat India was able to get Choksi arrested in Belgium is a diplomatic win for the government, but it is not clear when he can be extradited to India. This is because the process of extradition is often time consuming, especially since the country of extradition happens to be in Europe.\\n\\n\\n\\nMoreover, the experience with other high-profile fugitives, such as Modi and Vijay Mallya (he left India in 2016), has not been too rosy. Despite several attempts by India, both Mallya and Modi, who are currently based in the UK, have continued to remain out of the dragnet.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat could be a dampener in Choksi’s extradition from Belgium is the “dual-criminality” clause in the extradition treaty. This means a person can be extradited only if his or her offence, including financial bungling, is punishable in both jurisdictions involved, in this case both India and Belgium. That would mean Belgium should consider all charges against Choksi as alleged by India to be punishable under that country’s law.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere would be a lengthy judicial process involved before the extradition can happen. Moreover, there could be concerns related to human rights since Choksi was arrested in Belgium, where the European Convention on Human Rights applies, say media reports.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe ED had been trying to liquidate Choksi’s assets so that they can pay off the victims of the bank fraud, but the process has been slow. In February 2021, the ED attached assets worth Rs 14.45 crore belonging to the Gitanjali Group and Choksi in relation to the PNB scam.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe attached assets included a 1,460 square feet flat in Mumbai’s Goregaon, and gold and platinum jewellery, diamond, precious stones, pearl-silver necklaces, watches and a Mercedes Benz car registered in the name of Gitanjali Group and Choksi, the ED said. Earlier, the ED had attached properties worth more than Rs 2,550 crore in the matter.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nSubscribe to India Today Magazine\\n\\nPublished By: Mansi Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

CSK captain MS Dhoni was named the Player of the Match for his top-notch wicketkeeping behind the stumps and his knock of 26* off 11 balls. Speaking after the game, Dhoni took a sharp dig at the pitch provided to them in Chennai and called for better wickets at home going forward.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nChennai Super Kings have had a woeful start to the Indian Premier League 2025 season, winning just 2 matches out of 7. They have been especially poor at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, which was even till last year considered a fortress for the side. At the post-match presentation ceremony, Dhoni was asked about the side's timid show. The talismanic captain replied that one of the reasons behind their results was the Chennai pitch, which has not let them express themselves as a batting group.\\n\\n\\\"One of the reasons could be that the Chennai wicket is slightly on the slower side. When we have played away from home, the batting unit has done slightly better. Maybe we need to play on wickets that are slightly better so that it'll give the batters confidence to play their shots.

      "        \"title\": \"OnePlus 13T launch date announced: 7 things we already know about it\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"OnePlus has officially confirmed the launch of its next smartphone, the OnePlus 13T, in China on April 24. The company has already begun teasing the phone's design and features, offering a clear early look at what the device will bring to the table. Some of the specifications of the upcoming OnePlus phone have also leaked online. If you haven't been keeping tabs on the OnePlus 13T developments, here are 7 key things we already know about it ahead of the official launch.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nOnePlus 13T launch date announced: 7 things we already know about it\\n\\n-The OnePlus 13T will be available in three colours — Morning Mist Gray, Cloud Ink Black, and a special Pink edition. All three shades will feature a low-saturation matte finish, which OnePlus says aligns with its new design approach focused on subtlety and elegance.\\n\\n-OnePlus is seemingly ditching curves in favour of a more squared-off look. The 13T is confirmed to feature a 6.32-inch display with flat sides and rounded corners. This suggests that the 13T will have a compact form factor in comparison to the original OnePlus 13 smartphone.\\n\\n-The phone features what OnePlus calls a \\\"metal cube Deco\\\" — a one-piece metallic camera module that gives the back a more unified and refined feel. It marks a departure from previous designs and is intended to match the phone’s minimal aesthetics, something which the company suggested through its teasers.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n-The iconic Alert Slider is being replaced with a new button that can still toggle between silent, vibration, and ring modes. However, this button can also be customised for different tasks, which is likely to offer more flexibility than its predecessor.\\n\\n-The 13T will come with a dual rear camera setup. While OnePlus hasn’t detailed the sensors, leaks suggest a 50-megapixel main sensor paired with a 50-megapixel 2x telephoto lens. This combination hints at a focus on balanced performance rather than simply increasing sensor count.\\n\\n-One of the highlights of the 13T is its large battery, confirmed to be more than 6,000mAh. Alongside that, the phone is said to support 80W fast charging tech, which may make it suitable for power users who need reliability without frequent top-ups.\\n\\n-Under the hood, the phone is tipped to run on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Elite chipset, which also powered the OnePlus 13 smartphone. This would make it one of the most powerful (and affordable) OnePlus phones yet, paired with a 1.5K 120Hz OLED display that complements its performance with visuals to match.\\n\\nThe OnePlus 13T will be launched in China first, but global rollout details could follow soon after. It is important to note that a few details are based on the leaks and that the company is yet to confirm all the features of the device. But, you can stay tuned to India Today Tech for all the updates.\",\n",

Thus wrote septuagenarian M.C. Chalapati Rau, doyen of the ‘nationalist press’ and editor of the Herald for nearly four decades, in a letter addressed to Mrs Gandhi back in 1978.\\n\\nFour years after Rau left that huffy note and resigned, the cremation seemed to be still smouldering. Tottering on the verge of bankruptcy and unable to stem the tide of mismanagement and executive corruption, the Congress(I) high command - which holds controlling shares through a trust - was toying with two alternatives last fortnight: to close down most of its publications, or to sack the present board of directors of the company that publishes the Herald chain, Associated Journals Limited (turnover in 1980-81: Rs 2.5 crore).\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThe Chairman and Managing Director of Associated Journals, Yashpal Kapoor, Mrs Gandhi’s potbellied Man Friday, recently got a reprieve when the skeletal three-man directors’ board survived an annual general meeting with most shareholders submissively sending their proxy to Kapoor.\\n\\nBut the company’s balance sheet, which was surprisingly not circulated at the seemingly well-rehearsed annual general meeting, shows a whopping accumulated loss of Rs 70 lakh against an issued capital base of just Rs 56 lakh. The paper has started skipping editions because newsprint cannot be paid for; payment of wages has become irregular; the journalists, with fingers crossed, are waiting to jump out.\\n\\nTo cap it all, the charmed circle around Rajiv Gandhi has begun a discreet enquiry into the affairs of Associated Journals. Unconfirmed reports hint at Kapoor’s eventual succession by Arun Nehru, the MP from Uttar Pradesh.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nLiquidity: Talking to INDIA TODAY, Nehru side-stepped the issue of his possible charge by describing it as \\\"pre mature\\\". But he admitted having discussed the \\\"sickness’ of National Herald and its sister publications with his friend, Rajiv. Many Herald insiders would welcome Nehru for his \\\"high connection\\\" and the board-room experience he earned as managing director of a multinational paints company.\\n\\nHowever, a mere change of guard may not pull the company back from the financial precipice where it has landed itself. In a bid to expand senselessly and far beyond its means, the company has run into what Kapoor himself recognises as the \\\"gravest liquidity problem\\\" in its 44-year history. Samples:\\n\\nThe 496 employees at the New Delhi office were paid their salary for December two weeks after the due date. The chief editor, Hari Jaisingh, got his cheque on January 13.\\n\\nThe nearly 400 employees at the Lucknow office got their salary for October, and that too in instalments, in December.\\n\\nThe Press Trust of India withdrew its tickers from the Herald offices last fortnight after arrears crossed Rs 3 lakh.\\n\\nThe Municipal Corporation of Delhi served final notice on the company last fortnight that the water connection at its offices would be cut because of non-payment of Rs 80,000 of arrear bills.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThe Lucknow edition dropped a day’s issue in December because it had no cash to buy newsprint. It also can’t make blocks because the management says it is unable to buy an AC/DC converter worth Rs 3,000.\\n\\nA former employee, sacked six years ago, recently got a High Court decree issued against the company for payment of Rs 17,800 to him as compensation. Since the company said its coffers were empty even office equipment - such as cyclostyling machines - had to be seized and sold last fortnight to pay the ex-employee.\\n\\nA cheque for Rs 50, given to a contributor, bounced recently.\\n\\nThe Herald’s saga of hard luck does not end here. In 1976, its banker, Punjab National Bank, was compelled by the Emergency regime to sanction a fat loan to the company for the purchase of a Soviet-made rotary machine.\\n\\nThe loan was never paid back, and the bank went to court to obtain a decree of Rs 12 lakh against the company. It was a tricky situation for the guarantor, Vijaya Bank, which paid the money to Punjab National Bank but has little hope of getting back the instalments and interest. Another litigation is inevitable.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nNotorious reputation: The company is notoriously cynical about borrowing and not paying back. A loan of Rs 30 lakh raised by it in 1975-76 for construction of a new building in Lucknow has now become Rs 80 lakh with interest. \\\"We haven’t been able to pay back a copper of that,\\\" said Kapoor with what looked like an oddly satisfied smile.\\n\\nBehind this shoddy financial profile of the company, and the apparent ineptitude of its managers, lurks a systematic plan to keep it perpetually under the thumb of Mrs Gandhi and her chosen people. The key to it is held by Jan Hit Nidhi Trust, formed by Jawaharlal Nehru’s associates - P.N. Sapru, Umashankar Dixit and Padmaja Naidu - in the late ‘50s, which holds Rs 40 lakh of the Associated Journals’ Rs 56 lakh of issued capital.\\n\\nIts three present trustees are: P.A. Narielwala, former Tata employee, Congressman, and secretary to the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund; Umashankar Dixit, a former Union home minister and Congress(I) veteran; and, Bishambhar Nath Pandey, president of the Uttar Pradesh Congress(I) Committee. Apparently, all three of them repose their trust firmly in Mrs Gandhi.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nIn 1978, when Mrs Gandhi broke away to form her own party, the trustees took shelter behind a clause in the company’s 1938 article of association which said \\\"the policies of the newspapers published by the company will be to support and propagate the policies of the Indian National Congress\\\". The trustees - predictably - resolved that Mrs Gandhi’s party alone was the true Congress.\\n\\nIndividual shareholders: Besides the Trust, the company’s shares are held by about 300 individuals, only five of whom own shares worth more than Rs 1 lakh. Mrs Gandhi herself owns just Rs 1,000-worth of shares, for which she sent her proxy to Kapoor at the last annual general meeting.\\n\\nThe paper, which had a glorious record during the freedom movement, came up in the wake of the first popular ministry in Uttar Pradesh in 1937. Nehru and Rafi Ahmed Kidwai took the initiative, and funds poured in from all corners of the country. But subsequent leaders of the Herald deftly kept the original donors out of the picture.\\n\\nThe Tatas, for example, donated a sum of Rs 3 lakh which was in preference shares and was never converted into equities, thus denying the family reputed for its professional ability any say at the shareholders’ meetings.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nKapoor was chosen by Mrs Gandhi in 1978 when the previous managing director, Mohammed Yunus, resigned after submitting a strongly-worded report favouring closure of the Delhi edition of the paper. Yunus’ decision was born out of pragmatism: the Delhi edition sold just about 1,000 copies at that time compared with 5,000 for the Lucknow edition.\\n\\nBut Mrs Gandhi, pitted against generally hostile media, needed the Herald to continue in the capital, and Kapoor obliged her by continuing to roll out the Delhi edition, throwing overboard all financial considerations.\\n\\nUntraceable accounts: During the Emergency the company raked in enormous funds through questionable advertisement collections and doubtful and often unaccounted donations. An enquiry by the Company Law Board, the report of which was hushed up soon after the Congress(I)’s return to power, established that sources of an amount of Rs 4.87 crore, shown in the book of accounts, were \\\"untraceable\\\".\\n\\nHowever, after Mrs Gandhi’s defeat in 1977, sources of finance ran dry. Kapoor had to fall back on the age-old escape route from financial distress: robbing employees.\\n\\nHis management stopped transmitting employees’ insurance premiums; provident fund and health insurance dues were deducted from employees’ salary but not paid to the relevant departments; income tax deducted at source was not deposited; auditors checking the company’s balance sheets were aghast to find that there was no system of internal auditing.\\n\\nThis was topped with a paralysing lock-out in all offices of the Herald from March 1979 till the next year. The paper limped back to normalcy only after Mrs Gandhi came back to power in 1980.\\n\\nMeanwhile, journalists and other staff left the paper in droves, some in disgust, others out of sheer necessity. Even Khushwant Singh, who had a brief stint as the chief editor, faltered in his determination to improve Mrs Gandhi’s image when he was unable to make the management pay the staff their salary every month.\\n\\nPromises: Kapoor brought in Hari Jaisingh, a nondescript resident editor of the Ahmedabad edition of Indian Express, as the chief editor. With the happy tiding of 1980 came promises of more donations, more advertisements, more forced sales.\\n\\nKapoor reconstituted the board of directors, its two other members being Vimal Malhotra, a small-time industrialist who, as a trade union leader, had once headed the National Herald employees’ union, and Mallikarjun, deputy minister for Railways, who held the post in total violation of the convention that no minister should hold a director’s office.\\n\\nIn the name of expansion, the board opened up a chapter of unprecedented squander-mania. Three editions of the Herald’s sister Urdu publication, Quaumi Awaz, were started from Delhi, Bombay and Patna, apart from its usual Lucknow edition.\\n\\nA parallel unit was begun from New Delhi’s Indian and Eastern Newspapers Society (IENS) building to bring out English and Hindi editions of a little-known publication called Indian Farmers’ Journal. The other plans on the card include three new editions of Herald, and its Hindi co-publication, Navjivan (now brought out from Lucknow alone), from Bombay, Hyderabad and Bhopal.\\n\\nIn the process, however, the company’s real interest was diverted from newspapering to construction. Next to its present office at Kaiserbagh on the banks of the Gomti in Lucknow, it began a 12-storeyed building for Rs 4 crore; at Bhopal, it concluded a controversial land deal with the Bhopal Development Authority to start construction of yet another building for Rs 2 crore.\\n\\nVarious queries: From where did the promise of new capital come? And - as many in Herald are asking now - if money was at all available, why wasn’t it used to clear the debts to banks, the Government and the employees? However, Kapoor is not amused.\\n\\nRecently, he stopped deduction of provident fund for all employees drawing over Rs 1,600 a month on the plea that the Provident Fund Act allows him to do so - a contention not corroborated so far by the Fund authorities. Thus, he has escaped statutory obligations in every way on the plea of economy, but has still managed to go ahead with his grandiose ‘expansion plans’.\\n\\nLast fortnight, Kapoor, talking to INDIA TODAY, admitted that the buildings were to be financed by a \\\"group of businessmen\\\" who would \\\"not charge Herald a rupee\\\". But he was silent on:\\n\\n-Whether this transaction would be shown in the company’s books of account and, if so, how;\\n\\n-Why the concerned businessmen offered to make contributions; and,\\n\\n-How business in real estate was consistent with National Herald’s memorandum of association.\\n\\nBrushing these issues aside, Kapoor said: \\\"The main task is to make Associated Journals Limited immune to the Congress Party’s vicissitudes of fortune. We were victims of a systematic witch-hunt during the Janata period, when our advertisement earnings were forcibly lowered, our workers were instigated to go on strike, and the paper was dragged into a tangle of false litigations. The buildings will allow us relative independence even when the Congress is out of power. We want to be free from financial worries for all time to come.\\\"\\n\\nBoth Kapoor and Jaisingh claim to have gone a long way in ‘professionalising’ the organisation. \\\"We’ve been objective in our reporting and fair in our editorial views, within certain parameters, of course.\\\" defensively argues a mild-mannered Jaisingh. \\\"We even print Opposition news.\\\" piped in Kapoor more bluntly.\\n\\nHowever, as a senior journalist in the paper remarked, \\\"Herald projects only two leaders, if you may say so: Mrs Gandhi and Yashpal Kapoor.\\\" In 1981, Kapoor’s statements and photographs were front-paged over 50 times in the paper, variously describing him as \\\"senior Congress leader\\\", \\\"prominent leader of the Indian National Trade Union Congress\\\", and \\\"leading social worker\\\".\\n\\nQuipped the journalist, \\\"For the readers of the Herald - not a large community, I dare say - the race between the prime minister and Kapoor is quite a photo finish, with Rajiv Gandhi coming in as a distant third.\\\"\\n\\nToeing the line: On reporting political issues, the paper often toes the Congress(I) line in quite a brazen-faced manner. On the eve of the Opposition-sponsored Bharat Bandh on January 19, its two main front-page headlines read: \\\"Government to be tough on coercing strikers\\\" and \\\"More to ignore bandh\\\".\\n\\nWhen the Maharashtra chief minister, A.R. Antulay lost his case at Bombay High Court and resigned, the editorial in National Herald merely sang paeans of praise to Mrs Gandhi for being \\\"democratic\\\" in accepting Antulay’s resignation.\\n\\nHowever, its closeness to the Congress(I) gives it occasional flashes of insight: it was the only daily to predict the latest round of reshuffles in the Union Cabinet on the morning it took place.\\n\\nIt is true that there have been confusing trends once in a while; like the Herald suddenly publishing an article by T.N. Kaul criticising the recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan. But insiders promptly put it down to \\\"editorial ignorance\\\" of which way the wind was blowing.\\n\\nA front-page article criticising the Congress(I) chief ministers’ frequent trips to Delhi was explained by them as a subtle attempt to \\\"wangle\\\" state government advertisements.\\n\\nHowever, to ask the Herald authorities about its circulation - like asking a woman her age - is considered impolite. Though Jaisingh claims a weekday circulation of 20,000-plus in the capital and 30,000-plus in Lucknow, a representative of the National Herald Employees’ Union averred that the combined daily sale was \\\"within 15,000\\\".\\n\\nOn such a slender circulation base, how the paper brings out 10 to 12 supplements - loaded with ads - in a month is a mystery in the newspaper circle. In 1980-81, it netted Rs 1.25 crore from advertisements. As Kapoor fondly mused, \\\"Our ad and circulation boys are simply brilliant.\\\"\\n\\nThat again is a mystery. Last year, both the circulation and advertisement managers of the company quit their posts. The new circulation manager, who was catapulted to the office, was once a timekeeper in the Lucknow office, while the new advertisement manager was a clerk in the advertisement department.\\n\\nIn fact, examples of such spectacular rises are legion at National Herald: a sub-editor overnight finds himself in the chair of a leader writer, a junior sports sub is suddenly anointed as the sports editor, a line operator takes over as the chief press supervisor.\\n\\nChalapati Rau, who had once in disgust burnt copies of the paper at the site of Nehru’s cremation at Shantivana, remarked: \\\"The National Herald’s only editorial policy is to sing bhajans to Indira Gandhi and Yashpal Kapoor; its only business policy is to plunder resources and to secure ads by blackmail.\\\"\\n\\nFirmness: Rau has a right to vituperate. During the Emergency, when he was the chief editor, he did not allow any statement or photograph of Sanjay Gandhi, then all-powerful in the Congress, to appear in the paper. He refused to draw a salary of more than Rs 2,000 a month (Jaisingh gets Rs 8,000, including perks).\\n\\nEven Mrs Gandhi used to fear the sharpness of his tongue and the acid in his pen. In 1978, he was thrown out of office, and, since then, Kapoor has taken care to see that his Rs 1,500 monthly pension is stopped.\\n\\nEven a member of the Jan Hit Nidhi Trust, who refused to be identified, agrees that the paper has little viability unless \\\"we choose between two alternatives: to run it as a purely professional organisation, or to run it as a completely above-board party organ, free from wheeler-dealers’ interference\\\".\\n\\nHe cited the example of Hindustan Times, which started as a mouthpiece of the Gadr Party but later on became a commercial organisation under the Birlas, and survived. At the other end of the gamut, the two communist parties, he said, have been able to continue with their respective party organs without undue reliance on advertising revenue.\\n\\nBut the Herald, with its 900 staff, and its management’s all-consuming desire to turn it into a money-spinner, cannot but choose a half-way house from where it has to increasingly lean on non-newspaper profits: in 1980-81, it earned Rs 20 lakh by renting out its premises in Delhi.\\n\\n\\\"No newspaper\\\", said the sceptic trustee, \\\"has ever been profitable by propagating the views of one political party.\\\" Evidently not impressed by this line of argument, Kapoor counterposed, \\\"If the Congress can be a viable party, why can’t National Herald be a viable paper?\\\" No wonder that the current joke at the Herald office is to whisper aloud: \\\"We want Antulay\\\".\\n\\nSubscribe to India Today Magazine\\n\\nPublished By: Mansi Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"The second season of The Last of Us introduces new characters and a mysterious figure named Eugene, whose death stirs curiosity. Though never seen alive in the series, Eugene’s story, tied to Joel’s actions, leaves fans eager for answers. Here’s everything known about him from the HBO series and the games it’s based on.\\n\\n\\n\\n[SPOILERS AHEAD]\\n\\n\\n\\nHow is Eugene portrayed in The Last of Us game?\\n\\n\\n\\nIn The Last of Us Season two, Eugene is a background presence, never met but often mentioned by Ellie and Dina. They describe him as a funny, sharp man skilled with electronics, teaching Dina her technical know-how. A weed enthusiast, he left a lasting impression, but his life was troubled.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a Firefly resistance member, he was often away from his wife and child. Players find a note from his wife in an abandoned library outpost, pleading for his return. Dina shares darker tales, saying Eugene and Tommy committed terrorist acts, including an attack on FEDRA forces in Denver that killed three soldiers and two civilians. She also recalls the “slow-torturing” a FEDRA general, noting, “They got into some real dark s**t.”\\n\\n\\n\\nEllie and Dina say Eugene died at 73 from a stroke, likely without reuniting with his family.\\n\\n\\n\\nWho was Eugene?\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the HBO series, Eugene is introduced through Gail, Joel’s therapist, played by Catherine O’Hara. Like in the games, he grew marijuana, with Gail saying, “the man would grow buds the size of pinecones — sticky as glue.”\\n\\n\\n\\nUnlike the games, Gail was his wife, and Joel killed him. She confronts Joel, stating, “You shot and killed my husband. You killed Eugene, and I resent you for it. No, maybe a little more than that. I hate you for it. And yes, I know you had no choice. I know that. I know I should forgive you. But I tried, and I can’t. Because of how you did it.”\\n\\n\\n\\nGail marks her “first birthday without my husband in 41 years,” suggesting a recent death. Her comment that Joel had “no choice” hints Eugene was infected, but her anger suggests complexity. As per the Entertainment Weekly report, a flashback episode featuring Joe Pantoliano as Eugene will reveal more.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy did Joel kill Eugene?\\n\\n\\n\\nThe reason remains unclear. Gail’s belief that Joel had “no choice” points to Eugene being infected, but her deep resentment implies there’s more to the story.\\n\\n\\n\\nO’Hara told Entertainment Weekly, “I’ve never had to cry so much for so many takes,” about filming the flashback, calling it “killer.”\\n\\n\\n\\nCo-creator Neil Druckmann told Variety, “The story we told [in the game] was somewhat superficial. The way this character comes in really gets to the heart of Joel and Ellie and their relationship.”\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere and When to Watch The Last of Us?\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Last of Us Season two is currently streaming on Max, with season 2 episodes airing Sundays at 9 pm ET/PT and 8 pm CT. According to the Entertainment Weekly report, Eugene’s story adds depth to the series. His death, distinct from the game’s stroke to Joel’s actions in the show, sets up a pivotal moment that will explore Joel and Ellie’s bond, keeping viewers hooked.\\n\\nPublished By: Aashish Vashistha Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"title\": \"Like Adolescence, Indian films and shows that mastered one-shot technique\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"There's something about one-shot scenes that brings an inherent excitement, and a sense of unparalleled immersiveness to cinema. A section of the audience couldn't have been more aware of this camera technique until Netflix's 'Adolescence' broke the barriers of storytelling. It was raw, well-coordinated, demanding and so precise that it provided an extra edge to the story. But, this is not the first time that the Indian audience and filmmakers have woken up to this kind of camera movement technique.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nSeveral OTT shows and films have done the same over the years in various scenes to give the audience a taste of something different, something that sets them apart. Have a look at a few here:\\n\\n1. Ship of Theseus (2012): The mother is admitted scene (7 minutes)\\n\\nSohum Shah’s 'Ship of Theseus' wasn’t just a philosophical piece, it was also technically brilliant. One of its most powerful scenes, where a mother is admitted to the hospital, plays out in a 7-minute continuous take. The shot captures the chaotic yet intimate emotions of a man navigating bureaucracy, morality, and grief — all in one breathless sequence that never cuts away.\\n\\n2. Viduthalai (2023): The train scene (8 minutes)\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nVetri Maaran’s 'Vidhuthalai' delivers an edge-of-the-seat 8-minute sequence involving a train and a tense, escalating situation. Shot in a single take, the scene is a technical surprise, immersing the audience right into the unfolding drama with no moment to pause or look away. The fluid camera work and the unflinching performances make it one of the most gripping one-take sequences in Indian cinema.\\n\\n3. The Family Man (2019): Hospital assault sequence (13 minutes)\\n\\nShot in a real, functioning hospital with actual heart patients in the ward, this 13-minute one-take sequence is one of 'The Family Man's' most intense moments. Filmed from the villains' perspective, it builds a wave of dread as danger creeps toward unsuspecting characters.\\n\\nInterestingly, despite having just two nights at the expensive location — one for rehearsal, and another for shooting - co-director DK refused to break the shot. And the team pulled it off in a single go. It can definitely be seen as a masterclass in coordination, tension, and bold storytelling.\\n\\n4. Gangs of Wasseypur (2012): Home shootout (7 minutes)\\n\\nAnurag Kashyap’s 'Gangs of Wasseypur' is known for its gritty realism, and one of its standout moments is a seven-minute one-take sequence capturing a frantic shootout. The camera doesn't flinch and follows Faizal Khan's (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) character running through narrow alleys, ducking bullets, and raging through the violence. It's tense, raw, with a slight punch of humour making it deeply cinematic — a moment that stays with you long after the film ends.\\n\\n5. Dil Dhadakne Do (2015): The Gallan Goodiyan song (4 minutes)\\n\\nNot all one-take scenes are about action or intensity. Sometimes, it’s about capturing joy. The 'Gallan Goodiyan' song from 'Dil Dhadakne Do' is a vibrant 4-minute single-shot celebration, following the characters around a cruise ship dinner party as they sing and dance. It’s also something which can be seen as choreography-triumph, with a spontaneous and infectious sense of pure joy.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n6. CID - The Inheritance (111 minutes)\\n\\nOn November 7, 2004, Sony TV ran a special episode of CID, titled 'The Inheritance', without any single cut. BP Singh, the director of the show, wanted to make an entry into the Guinness Book of World Records and Limca Book of Records, and therefore, he decided to shoot a 111-minute-long episode of the popular show using the one-shot technique, which later went into the pages of history. It didn't just create a record for the longest shot episode, but also for the longest shot to be filmed ever.\\n\\nThe one-shot sequences are demanding. They demand perfection, a solid hold on one's craft, and the best kind of coordination between artistes, cinematographers, directors and the audience. At the end of it all lies audacity, and a spirit to experiment. Indian cinema and the OTT space got to stay on the hustle.\\n\\nPublished By: Vineeta Kumar Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

The actor, who was travelling with his wife to Delhi, wrote a long note on social media, explaining what all conspired to make his journey look like a nightmare.\\n\\nThe 45-year-old shared that his wife was suffering from a fractured foot and, therefore, they paid for some extra service, but nothing helped during the journey. Das, who is an International Emmy Award-winning comedian, revealed that he was greeted by a \\\"broken table, broken leg rests\\\" and a stuck seat which refused to straighten.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n\\\"We’re flying to Delhi. 50grand a seat. Broken table, broken leg rests, her seat is stuck reclined, won’t straighten fully. Were told the flight is ‘newly refurbished’. Two hours late, we get off in Delhi and we’re told it’s a stepladder. Again wheelchair and encalm pre-booked. I ask the air hostesses at the front of the plane to assist my wife while I carry four bags. Silence and a clueless look at each other. We step off the plane to the top of the ladder (sic),\\\" he wrote in his X post.\\n\\nDas went on to mention how the horror didn't stop there and he continued to face issues with even the on-ground staff at the airport. \\\"We get to the terminal, encalm people inform wheelchair staff that we had pre booked a chair. He’s clueless. There’s wheelchairs everywhere. No staff because the flight is late. I grab a chair and wheel her to baggage claim, then out of the airport to the parking (sic),\\\" he added.\\n\\nCheck out Vir Das's full post criticising Air India here:\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nInterestingly, Air India responded to Vir Das's post in the comments section after three hours. \\\"Dear Mr. Das, we understand and empathize with the experience. Please share us the booking details via DM for us to look into this on priority (sic),\\\" read the comment from the official X handle of the airline.\\n\\nDas responded with sarcasm and wrote, \\\"AI816.

While he often finds himself in the middle of a controversy for finding humour in the most contentious things, he's known for his smart comedy and sarcastic commentary during his stage acts.\\n\\nAir India later released a statement in the media, explaining their side of the story. In a detailed statement, the airline admitted the mistake, but maintained that the service was not 'denied', only 'delayed'. The statement read, \\\"We have noted with concern a social media post by Mr Das about a wheelchair not being provided to his co-passenger while travelling from Mumbai to Delhi on AI816 on 14 April 2025. We empathise with the guests, especially given the mobility concern involved, and recognize that this experience fell short of expectations. The operating cabin crew offered to assist the guest, including deplaning by using the 'ambulift' assigned to the aircraft as per SOP, but the delay—not denial—in providing wheelchair assistance was due to unusually high demand for wheelchairs and staff at that time. Air India remains committed to improving the end-to-end travel experience for all its guests (sic).\\\"\\n\\nPublished By: Vineeta Kumar Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

It will introduce the Harrier.ev and the Sierra.ev in FY26.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n\\\"As the leader of the Indian EV market, we are committed to a portfolio of innovative and compelling EVs that resonate with the diverse use cases of discerning customers. We recently showcased the Harrier.ev at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo 2025, with its launch planned in FY26,\\\" Srivatsa told India Today.\\n\\nThe Harrier.ev is based on Tata's pure EV architecture -- acti.ev+. The electric SUV will have a quad-wheel-drive (QWD) dual motor setup, delivering 500Nm of peak torque. \\\"We are targeting a real-world range of around 500km, addressing range anxiety,\\\" Srivatsa said.\\n\\nThe real-world range for EVs is usually lower than the range certified by Modified Indian Drive Cycle. Among the Tata EVs, the Curvv.ev has the highest real-world range of up to 425km on a single full charge, followed by the Nexon.ev of up to 375km.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nAccording to data from the industry body Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA), Tata's electric car sales fell 10.71% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 57,616 units in FY25 from 64,530 units in FY24. Moreover, the segment share dropped to 53.52% in FY25 from 70.52% in FY24.\\n\\nThe arrival of rival original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) like Mahindra and JSW MG Motor India with new models in the electric car space is among the reasons for Tata's share taking a hit.\\n\\nWhen asked about the decline in Tata's share, Srivatsa said: \\\"With more players, the share will certainly even itself out, but we know we will continue to lead the category, leveraging our deep understanding of the Indian consumer and their nuances.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Temporary challenges do not deter us, as the largest four-wheeler manufacturer in this space, we offer the widest range of EVs, priced between Rs 8 lakh and Rs 22 lakh across a variety of body styles and battery pack options. This is a portfolio tailor-made to the Indian customers' preference and use case, unlike other products in the market, which are derivatives of offerings tailored to global markets, with very little Indian context,\\\" he observed.\\n\\nHaving started with the Nexon.ev in 2020, Tata has sold over 2,00,000 units of electric cars till now. The company manufactures EVs across its Pune, Ranjangaon and Sanand facilities.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nEarlier this year, Tata introduced the Open Collaboration 2.0 framework to enhance India's EV charging ecosystem. It aims to more than double the number of charging points to 4,00,000 by 2027 in partnership with charge point operators (CPOs) and oil marketing companies (OMCs).\\n\\n\\\"India's charging infrastructure is more of a chicken and egg story, with increasing EV adoption, charging points too will increase. Private CPOs are imperative in setting up a charging infrastructure that works for the benefit of the customer. Critically, it is the private players who are laying the groundwork for a sustainable, EV-centric future,\\\" Srivatsa said.\\n\\nSubscribe to Auto Today Magazine\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"Just days after the NEET UG controversy, the National Testing Agency (NTA) is once again facing sharp criticism -- this time over factual mistakes and technical issues in the JEE Main 2025 Session 2 exam.\\n\\nStudents, parents, and educators are up in arms after the release of the provisional answer key and response sheets on April 11.\\n\\nCOACHING HUB KOTA FLAGS MULTIPLE ERRORS\\n\\nThe latest storm was kicked off by students from Kota, Rajasthan -- India’s biggest coaching hub for engineering aspirants, as per a Times of India report. These students spotted at least nine questionable answers in the JEE Main 2025 April 9 paper.\\n\\nThe errors span all three core subjects: four in physics, three in chemistry, and two in maths. Students say the problems aren’t just tricky questions -- they are factually incorrect and could seriously affect scores.\\n\\nTop coaching centres and subject experts backed the students’ claims, saying the problems show poor quality control by NTA for such a major national exam.\\n\\nEducator and commentator @kamath_pramod posted on X, “It’s unacceptable that such basic mistakes are creeping into national-level exams.” He highlighted one modern physics question from the April 7 AM shift, calling it “conceptually flawed.”\\n\\nHe added, “If NTA doesn’t correct this, it’s an injustice to lakhs of students.”\\n\\nAnother user on X put it bluntly: “Tragedy of errors – JEE Main response sheet is different from what students actually filled in many cases + lot of answers wrongly given by NTA.”\\n\\nRESPONSE SHEET MESS ADDS TO STUDENTS’ WORRIES\\n\\nThe issue goes beyond just the answer key. Several candidates and their parents reported major errors in the response sheets shared by NTA. Some students said their selected answers were wrongly recorded, while others found the sheets showing blank responses.\\n\\nPramod Kamath, who is also a parent, posted on social media, “Indeed my daughter attempted 71 questions. During submission it showed 71 questions attempted & now in the response sheet it is showing all questions as unanswered! Shocking! NTA is playing with the future of children. No response on email!”\\n\\nAnother student, who appeared for the April 3 shift 2 exam, said he had selected the first option for a physics question, but the response sheet now shows the second option.\\n\\nOne parent, Rekha Verma, wrote on X, “My daughter has attempted 50 questions but it is showing 48. So many questions showing the wrong attempt. We will mail to NTA for this blunder. I am very worried for her.”\\n\\nA different user added, “Actually we are also experiencing similar issue on answer sheet shared by NTA. We request to the management to review and publish error free results.”\\n\\nA mother whose daughter regularly scored between 180-190 in practice tests said her child’s answer sheet now shows several incorrect options that were not marked by her.\\n\\n'BLANK' ANSWERS AND UNRESPONSIVE NTA\\n\\nSome students even reported that the system simply didn’t record their answers at all. One X user shared, “Answers submitted were not considered and shows up as ‘blank’. An email to NTA went unanswered. Ridiculous that they conduct an exam for such premier institutes and are least bothered about the transparency. Who will guard the guards?”\\n\\nIn another post, someone said the same issue occurred with his sister’s paper -- one question was missing her chosen answer entirely.\\n\\nOPPOSITION LEADERS JOIN IN, QUESTION NTA’S CREDIBILITY\\n\\nAs reports of errors spread, political leaders also stepped in, questioning the NTA’s ability to conduct high-stakes exams.\\n\\nReferring to the TOI report, Congress leader Supriya Shrinate posted in Hindi on X:\\n\\n“The NTA is already facing questions over the conduct of competitive exams – last year's CUET-UG, NEET-UG answer sheets also had errors. Is the NTA capable of conducting these exams? Was the tension of unemployment and paper leaks not enough for our youth that now they have to deal with a weak NTA as well?”\\n\\nWHAT NEXT FOR STUDENTS?\\n\\nThe window to challenge the JEE Main 2025 Session 2 answer key has already closed, and the results are expected by April 17. But with so many discrepancies raised -- from factual errors to technical glitches -- students are demanding that the NTA drop the flawed questions or award bonus marks.\\n\\nSo far, there’s been no official response from the agency. With lakhs of students depending on this exam to secure a place in top engineering colleges, the silence is only fuelling anxiety.\\n\\nAll eyes are now on the NTA -- will it admit to the issues and act, or leave students to bear the consequences?\\n\\nPublished By: Roshni Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"Union minister Kiren Rijiju defended the recent amendments to the Waqf Act, arguing the changes were necessary to prevent arbitrary land grabs and address long-standing grievances.\\n\\nSpeaking in Kerala on Tuesday, Union Minister Kiren Rijiju said the move was vital to protecting people’s rights over their land. “Land is the most precious thing. Many countries go to war for it. We must protect every inch for its rightful owner,” he said.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nRijiju criticised the past provisions of the Act for giving “unprecedented powers” to Waqf boards, which he alleged had been misused in several cases—including the Munambam land dispute in Kerala.\\n\\nThe Munambam case, where the Kerala Waqf Board declared 404 acres as Waqf property, allegedly depriving over 600 fishermen of ownership, was a focal point of his address. Rijiju called it a “tragedy” and promised justice. “The government will ensure such cases do not happen again,” he said.\\n\\nHe said that as part of the reforms, the Centre has struck down Section 40 of the Act, which had empowered Waqf Boards to unilaterally declare any land as Waqf. “No authority should have uncontrolled power. All future surveys will be led by the District Collector and based strictly on government records,” Rijiju said.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nHe flagged the scale of unchecked claims, stating that over 18 lakh properties were declared as Waqf between 2013 and 2025. “If we don’t act now, people will continue losing ownership. Once declared Waqf, it’s irreversible—that cannot continue,” he said.\\n\\nThe amended law now makes a registered Waqf deed mandatory for any claim. It also bars the declaration of disputed or sub-judice land as Waqf. Another major change is the removal of the “Waqf by user” clause, which allowed claims without documentation. “That was dangerous,” Rijiju said.\\n\\nThe Minister also announced that all state Waqf boards and tribunals will be reconstituted. Explaining the legal premise, he said, “If a Waqif dedicates a property, then it becomes Waqf—but it cannot be transferred. That’s the core of the Munambam issue. It can be challenged.”\\n\\nTaking aim at the Congress, Rijiju said the 2013 amendments made by the party allowed sweeping Waqf claims. “We’ve now brought in strict safeguards,” he said. The new law also allows appeals against Waqf Tribunal decisions in High Courts and restructures board and tribunal composition.\\n\\nRijiju said he would visit Munambam later that evening to meet affected residents. Referring to a case involving Mohammad Siddiqui Sait, he said, “Once land is transferred, it is no longer Waqf. The High Court ruling can be challenged in the Supreme Court.”\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nHe urged the Kerala government to act swiftly. “We’re in a federal setup. We’ve made the law, now the state must implement it. The Centre will provide all legal and administrative support to help people reclaim their land.”\\n\\nAddressing concerns that the amendments target Muslims, Rijiju said, “There’s a false campaign claiming we’re anti-Muslim. In fact, crores of poor Muslims have also been denied Waqf benefits. The majority get nothing. This law is not against any community.”\\n\\nHe also flagged other alleged overreaches. “In some instances, Waqf Boards have unilaterally declared entire villages and even Parliament as Waqf property. One person even claimed a third of Delhi. These kinds of unlimited claims will no longer be allowed. Our position is very clear.”\\n\\nPublished By: Afreen Published On: Apr 15, 2025\\n\\nTune In\",\n",

The introduction of tripartite partnerships between universities, students, and industry, is expected to make education more inclusive, practical, and outcome-driven.\\n\\nIndian organizations engaged nearly one million apprentices in 2023–24 (a 26 fold jump in the last five years) yet they constitute just 0.18% of the workforce, compared to 2%-3% engagement in developed countries. Scaling the AEDP model is essential to bridge India’s employability gap, considering that only 54.81% of youth are deemed employable.\\n\\nFor universities, success depends on three interventions: strong industry partnerships, robust curriculums embedded with apprenticeships, and governance for tracking and mentorship. Operational readiness—faculty training, curriculum redesign, and alignment with sector skill councils—is critical. Partnering with established Third Party Aggregators, who have the requisite experience for managing apprenticeship lifecycles, would be a key area to becoming AEDP ready.\\n\\nWith 12 million youth entering the workforce each year, AEDP offers a pragmatic path to prepare them for rapidly evolving business needs. Unlocking this potential will require policy support and institutional agility to truly harness India’s demographic dividend.\\n\\n(The author is the Chief Executive Officer, TeamLease Degree Apprenticeship)\",\n",

Nothing can match a chief minister's shocking silence over people being hacked to death or hundreds forced to flee for fear of being killed in a communal pogrom. That's what West Bengal is witnessing as Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and other Trinamool Congress leaders appeal to the aggressors, while not sparing a thought for the victims.\\n\\nRealpolitik and pragmatism should stop at the doors of death at least.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThat West Bengal is a communal cauldron in which parties have parboiled their politics is stating the obvious. But allowing mobs of a community to run riot for days shows both administrative lethargy and political licence. Then comes the abject apathy towards thousands of victims.\\n\\nWest Bengal has seen the most violent protests against the new waqf law that resulted in deaths and people fleeing their homes. Though protests erupted in several states, including Kerala, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh, no state burnt like Bengal did.\\n\\nThe timeline shows that the protests were preplanned. It also shows either a failure in the state's intelligence-gathering mechanism, or it's allowing a free run to communal mobs.\\n\\nThe Waqf Amendment Bill, 2025, was passed on April 4, and received the President's nod on April 5. Large-scale violent protests in West Bengal started only on April 11, after the Friday prayers.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nProtesters clashed with police, set fire to the homes and businesses of Hindus and looted shops. A father-son duo -- Horogobindo and Chandan Das -- were hacked to death in Mushidabad, a Muslim-majority district and epicentre of the rioting.\\n\\nA mob broke into the home of the artisans, dragged the two out, and hacked them to death even as the women of the family fell on the feet of the attackers in a desperate bid to save the men.\\n\\nHundreds of Hindus of Murshidabad, mostly women and children, fled their homes using boats to cross the Ganga to Malda.\\n\\nThe videos are out there -- people claiming the West Bengal police didn't act against the aggressors, and remained mute spectators. That, despite hours of calling police stations, there was no help and that they were left to be the prey of marauding mobs.\\n\\nThe violence continued for a second day on Saturday, and it was only after the intervention of the Calcutta High Court that central forces were deployed in rioting-hit areas of West Bengal. Incidents of violence were reported on Monday from South 24 Parganas, the district adjoining Kolkata.\\n\\nAll through the pogrom, Mamata Banerjee and other Trinamool leaders kept dealing with the rioters with kid gloves.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nOn Saturday, Mamata declared that she wouldn't be implementing the new waqf law in West Bengal. She was addressing the rioters in violence-hit areas of Murshidabad district, appealing for peace.\\n\\n\\\"We have made our position clear on this matter - we do not support this law. This law will not be implemented in our state. So what is the riot about?\\\" Mamata wrote on X.\\n\\n\\\"My sincere appeal to all people of all religions, please remain calm, remain restrained. Do not engage in any unrighteous behaviour in the name of religion. Every human life is precious. Do not incite riots for the sake of politics. Those who are inciting riots are harming the society,\\\" she further stressed.\\n\\nTrinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra appealed to Muslims with \\\"folded hands\\\" for peace. The Krishnanagar MP said she had filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court against the new law.\\n\\n\\\"Like we didn't allow NRC on the soil of Bengal, the Mamata Banerjee government wouldn't allow the waqf law to be implemented,\\\" Moitra said in a video appeal to Muslims.\\n\\nThe BJP said that no TMC minister had been arrested for inciting violence against Hindus. \\\"Because under Mamata Banerjee, hate against Hindus isn’t a crime -- it’s a strategy,\\\" it said.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nMuslims have been one of the core voter segments for the Trinamool Congress. And given the state's demography, it is a crucial vote base.\\n\\nMuslims comprised 27% of Bengal's population, according to the 2011 Census.\\n\\nAIMIM leader Imran Solanki had in March claimed that Muslims constituted 40% of Bengal's population. Last year, Kolkata Mayor and Bengal Cabinet minister Firhad Hakim said that Muslims were 33% of the state's population.\\n\\nOn the 400 Hindu families forced to flee from their homes, as BJP leader Amit Malviya claimed, TMC's Firhad Hakim said, \\\"People are relocating within Bengal, not fleeing the state. It is because West Bengal is safe that they are staying within the state.\\\" Earlier, BJP MLA Suvendu Adhikari had claimed that \\\"more than 400 Hindus from Dhulian, Murshidabad,\\\" were forced to flee the riots.\\n\\nHakim, echoed his leader Mamata Banerjee, and urged the mob to head to Delhi to protest, where the Waqf Act was passed.\\n\\n\\\"Today, they belittle exodus. Tomorrow, they will normalise extermination,\\\" said Amit Malviya, BJP's IT cell chief, slamming Hakim for branding the crisis as \\\"intra-state migration\\\".\\n\\nWhat makes the tragedy of Hindus being forced to flee their homes worse is that Bengalis across the world are celebrating April 15 as Noboborsho, the Bengali new year.\\n\\nDespite killings of Hindus and destruction of their homes and businesses by Muslim mobs, there has been no strong condemnation or display of intent from the Trinamool leadership. They have either appeared with folded hands or tried to use kid gloves for violent mobs. Such mollycoddling will not only encourage the aggressors, it will alienate the Hindus of the state.\\n\\nPublished By: Sushim Mukul Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"A Congress MLA in Tamil Nadu, Hasan Maulana, assured residents that no one would be evicted from a Vellore village where a dargah had issued eviction notices after claiming the land as Waqf property.\\n\\nHowever, he added that villagers would be required to pay a nominal rent if the Waqf Board’s claim to the land is substantiated by supporting documents. “Once a Waqf, always a Waqf,” Maulana said.\\n\\nHis remarks came after about 150 families in Kattukollai village, in Vellore district, reportedly received notices stating that their land belongs to the Waqf.\\n\\nThe notices were issued by a person named F Syed Satham, who claimed that the land in Kattukollai belongs to a local dargah. India Today accessed a notice sent by Satham to a man named Balaji, accusing him of encroaching on Waqf land registered under survey number 362. According to the notice, Balaji had constructed a house and a shop on the property, which, as per Waqf records, belongs to the mosque.\\n\\nThe notice stated that residents must seek permission, pay ground rent, and comply with Waqf laws—or face legal eviction.\\n\\nSyed Sadam, who became caretaker of the dargah and mosque following his father's death in 2021, claims the land has belonged to the Waqf Board since 1954 and says they have documents to prove it.\\n\\nAccording to Sadam, his late father lacked formal education and awareness and therefore did not collect rent from those living on the land. Now, Sadam says he intends to rectify this by collecting rent from the residents.\\n\\nHe stated that two more notices will be sent, and if there is no response, the matter will be taken to the High Court.\\n\\nThe residents, however, say they have lived on the land for four generations and consider it their own. They are upset that Sadam is now demanding rent, whereas his father never did.\\n\\nThe issue gained attention when concerned villagers gathered at the District Collector’s office fearing eviction. Praveen Kumar, Divisional Secretary of the Hindu Munnani, said all 150 families had received similar notices, despite having government-issued documents and paying panchayat taxes. He urged the Collector to grant official land titles (patta) to the villagers, who are anxious about losing their homes and livelihoods.\\n\\nAccording to the residents, the Vellore District Collector has informally advised them not to pay rent for now.\\n\\nThis is the second such Tamil Nadu village that has been claimed by the Waqf law. Previously, a Tiruchendurai village was also sent similar notices saying the land belonged to Waqf board.\\n\\nPublished By: Preeja Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"Niu Gensheng, China’s dairy tycoon’s life is nothing short of inspiring. He was sold as a baby for just 50 yuan (around Rs 600), but today, he’s the man behind a company earning over $410 million a year. His journey from hardship to huge success shows what grit, smart thinking, and a little rebellion against the norm can really do, reported South China Morning Post.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nNow 67, Niu is the founder of Mengniu Dairy—one of China’s biggest dairy companies—and the brain behind Aice, a renowned ice cream brand in Southeast Asia.\\n\\nNiu was born into a poor family in Inner Mongolia. His parents couldn’t afford to raise him, so they sold him to a cattle farmer. The farmer adopted him, but life was still full of challenges.\\n\\nAt the age of eight, Niu was forced to sweep the streets and do heavy labour after his adoptive father lost everything in a political dispute. Not long after, both his adoptive parents passed away.\\n\\nIn 1983, Niu found a job as a bottle washer in a small dairy factory. That same factory would later grow into Yili, one of China’s top dairy brands. Niu worked hard, learnt the ropes, and eventually became Vice-President of Production and Operations. At his peak, he was earning over a million yuan a year.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nBut success didn’t stop the challenges. Office politics and rising competition made things tough, and Niu decided to step away.\\n\\nIn 1999, Niu took a brave step. With 10 million yuan in hand, he launched Mengniu Dairy. His previous employer, Yili, was already worth over a billion yuan at that time. But Niu had a different approach—he focused on rural areas, advertised in local languages, and kept his products affordable. People connected with his brand, and by 2005, Mengniu became China’s top dairy name.\\n\\nNot stopping there, Niu looked to Southeast Asia. In 2015, he launched Aice in Indonesia, an ice cream brand made for everyone. His goal was simple: make good quality ice cream affordable for all.\\n\\nWith prices between Rs 5 to Rs 9, Aice offered popular flavours like durian and coconut milk coffee. Niu also helped local shopkeepers by giving them free freezers and subsidising electricity costs. This made Aice a hit—now it operates in over 1,200 districts across Indonesia and leads the region’s ice cream market.\\n\\nHe supports medical care for critically ill children in Inner Mongolia and helps build schools across China.\",\n",

      "        \"title\": \"Why ICAI has decided to hold CA final exams thrice a year\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"Over the past decade, there has been a nearly 30% drop in student registrations — from 3,11,000 in 2013 to just 2,24,000 in 2022.\\n\\nPhoto: Canva image\\n\\nIn a significant move towards reforming professional education in India, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has declared that, beginning in January 2025, the Chartered Accountancy (CA) Final examination will be held three times a year — in January, May, and September. This brings the final level in line with the Foundation and Intermediate stages, which already follow a triannual exam pattern.\\n\\nThis decision has both strategic and student-centric motivations. One key factor is the increasing urgency to scale up the number of Chartered Accountants in the country. ICAI’s former President, Ranjeet Kumar Agarwal, highlighted that India will require over 30 lakh (3 million) CAs by 2047, to mark the 100th year of independence. Presently, the ICAI has around 4 lakh members and approximately 8.5 lakh active students. To meet the projected target, the country will need to produce more than 1.3 lakh qualified CAs each year — a figure that makes the increase in exam frequency not only logical but necessary.\\n\\nAnother challenge that prompted this change is the decline in new enrolments into the CA course. Over the past decade, there has been a nearly 30% drop in student registrations — from 3,11,000 in 2013 to just 2,24,000 in 2022. One of the key reasons is the growing popularity of global alternatives such as CPA, ACCA, and CFA, which offer higher pass percentages and more adaptable exam schedules. For instance, CFA’s pass rates stand at 45% for Level 1, 39% for Level 2, and 48% for Level 3. CPA typically sees success rates between 45% and 55%, and ACCA’s pass rates vary between 37% and 89% across its 13 papers. In contrast, the CA Final pass rate remains at a much tougher 13.44% (both groups), with Intermediate at 14.05% and Foundation at 21.52%.\\n\\nThe international context is also telling. Qualifications such as ACCA hold exams four times a year, the CPA follows a rolling schedule, and CFA exams are held between two and four times annually. The former twice-yearly model of CA exams had become an outlier. By moving to thrice-a-year attempts, ICAI is bridging that gap and aligning itself with global standards — a step that will no doubt enhance its credibility on the world stage.\\n\\nBeyond numbers, the reform brings welcome relief to students. The current six-month gap between exam cycles often prolongs uncertainty and hampers momentum, especially for those who narrowly miss passing. With the reduced four-month interval between attempts, students can now regroup, re-evaluate, and reattempt within a shorter window. This change could significantly reduce the average time taken to complete the qualification. Additionally, ICAI has introduced multiple-choice questions (MCQs) across all papers at the Intermediate and Final stages, promoting clarity of concepts and encouraging analytical thinking.\\n\\nHowever, this increased flexibility comes with its own set of expectations. Students must avoid the temptation of attempting the exams prematurely and instead focus on solid, methodical preparation. The additional exam windows should be viewed as a chance to pace one’s studies, not to dilute the rigour of the course.\\n\\nThose who have experienced the grind of the CA journey — the long hours, the repeated revisions, and the psychological toll of high-stakes exams — will particularly appreciate the value of this reform. Earlier, a failed attempt often meant waiting six months to try again, which took an emotional toll. Now, with shorter wait times, aspirants have more opportunities to learn from setbacks and move forward with renewed determination.\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"Decision branded a threat to linguistic diversity and federal values, as criticism mounts from non-Hindi states\\n\\nImage by Canva\\n\\nKerala's General Education and Employment Minister, V. Sivankutty, has strongly criticised the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) for its latest decision to provide Hindi titles for English-medium textbooks. Calling the move a \\\"grave illogicality,\\\" Sivankutty accused the central government of imposing culture and denigrating India's rich linguistic diversity.\\n\\nThe Minister contended that substituting time-honored English titles with Hindi equivalents like Mridang, Santoor, and Poorvi for 1 to 6 classes is not just improper but also conveys a misguided message to young students. \\\"It is wrong to reject English titles that have been there for decades, particularly when they promote inclusivity and tolerance for language diversity in young minds,\\\" he stated on Monday.\\n\\nSivankutty emphasised that English-medium students should be given English titles, and he opined further that the title of textbooks contributes a lot towards children's imagination and worldview. He also cautioned that this action goes against federal principles and values of the Constitution.\\n\\nRatifying the views of other states that do not speak Hindi, he stated that Kerala was determined to uphold linguistic diversity and protect the cultural sovereignty of regions. \\\"Education must be a means to empowerment and respect for each other's languages, not a means for one language to dominate another,\\\" the Minister said.\\n\\nInviting collective resistance, Sivankutty called for NCERT to reverse and withdraw the changes, and appealed to all the states to stand together against what he described as \\\"unwarranted imposition\\\".\\n\\nThis controversy follows NCERT's launch of rechristened textbooks as per the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. The process of renaming has resurfaced language policy debates, with Kerala and Tamil Nadu leaders accusing the Centre of imposing Hindi through education reforms. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. K. Stalin has earlier expressed the same fears, condemning the Centre for not releasing funds to states that are reluctant to adopt the three-language formula under NEP.\",\n",

      "        \"title\": \"The role of character development in academic achievement\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"Character development is emerging as the key to holistic education, preparing students not just for exams but for life in a complex, digital world.\\n\\nImage from canva\\n\\nAmid rapid technological advancement and increasing global complexity, education stakeholders are beginning to question the adequacy of traditional academic metrics like grades and standardized tests. There is a noticeable shift toward a more holistic view of student success—one that values intellectual achievements and the development of emotional and social competencies. This evolving perspective acknowledges that character is integral to long-term success. Consequently, character development is gradually being recognized not as a supplementary aspect of education but as a core component for preparing students for the demands of a dynamic and interconnected world.\\n\\nThe shift from IQ to EQ\\n\\nIn recent years, research and educational policies have increasingly emphasised that the intelligence quotient (IQ) alone does not define a student's potential. Emotional intelligence (EQ)—encompassing traits such as self-awareness, empathy, and self-regulation—and character attributes like curiosity, resilience, and determination have emerged as equally critical for academic and personal success.\\n\\nStudents with strong emotional and character skills are better equipped to navigate academic pressures, overcome setbacks, and stay motivated through challenges. These qualities also serve as protective factors for mental well-being, reducing the risk of stress, anxiety, and burnout. When schools deliberately foster character development and socio-emotional learning, they promote inner strength and build a supportive culture where students feel safe, respected, and empowered.\\n\\nThe classroom as a character lab\\n\\nProgressive educational institutions are increasingly embracing a comprehensive approach to character development, where classrooms function as laboratories for fostering vital life skills. This goes beyond merely occasional moral science classes or motivational speeches.\\n\\nInstead, it involves establishing a culture that integrates values such as respect, responsibility, and empathy into daily teaching and interactions. Collaborative projects, debates, and open discussions can encourage teamwork, empathy, and critical thinking, while supportive educators can assist students in learning from their mistakes and building resilience.\\n\\nNurturing character in the digital world\\n\\nIn the digital age, character development extends beyond physical classrooms and playgrounds into online interactions. Cultivating digital citizenship becomes essential as students increasingly engage with social media, collaborative tools, and digital platforms. This involves fostering responsible, respectful, and ethical behaviour in virtual environments—whether refraining from cyberbullying, respecting intellectual property, or maintaining honesty in online academic submissions.\\n\\nBy integrating digital responsibility into character education, schools can help students navigate the complexities of the digital world with integrity. Encouraging critical thinking about online behaviour strengthens students' moral compasses and prepares them to become thoughtful, empathetic contributors to the global digital community.\\n\\nHolistic education: An emerging trend\\n\\nA notable development in global education policy is the growing emphasis on holistic education, which seeks to cultivate students' intellectual, emotional, social, and ethical development. International bodies such as the OECD and UNESCO have underscored the importance of this paradigm, advocating for educational systems that not only equip learners with academic skills but also enable them to thrive in complex and dynamic contexts.\\n\\nReflecting the global shift toward holistic education, India’s National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 emphasizes value-based learning and integrating socio-emotional learning (SEL) into the curriculum. By moving beyond rote learning and exam-driven models, the policy aims to foster critical thinking, empathy, and ethical awareness—preparing students to become academically proficient, emotionally resilient, and socially responsible individuals.\\n\\nThe educator’s role: Shaping character through action\\n\\nEducators are central to a student’s character journey—not just as instructors but as role models and mentors. Their authenticity, fairness, and empathy set the tone for a positive, value-driven learning environment. Students often absorb these behaviors, making it crucial for teachers to lead by example.\\n\\nCharacter development also unfolds through how teachers face challenges, transform mistakes into learning opportunities, and promote respectful dialogue. Structured mentorship, peer support, and reflective activities enhance students' emotional and ethical growth. Educators help integrate character education into the school culture by collaborating with families and demonstrating consistency and values. Ultimately, their daily actions leave the most lasting impact on a student’s development.\\n\\nAs the world becomes more complex, education must evolve to address the full spectrum of human potential. While knowledge and technical skills can open doors, character—resilience, empathy, integrity, and purpose—ultimately determines how far a student will go. Institutions that nurture intellectual and moral development empower learners to succeed academically and thrive as responsible, adaptable citizens in a rapidly changing world.\\n\\nThe time has come to reimagine classrooms as spaces where values are lived, not merely taught. When educators lead purposefully, mindfully utilize digital platforms, and prioritize mental well-being alongside academic rigor, we create an education system that prepares students for exams and life.\\n\\nThe author is the Dean (Training), Chair (Placement & Corporate Relations), Assistant Professor (Business Analytics), Jaipuria Institute of Management, Jaipur.\",\n",

The total number of students placed at NITs also fell by 10.77%, from 18,957 in 2022-23 to 16,915 in 2023-24, reported Hindustan Times.\\n\\nThe panel's findings reveal a shift towards a \\\"more skill-centric hiring process,\\\" signalling a \\\"structural evolution in campus recruitment.\\\" This evolution emphasises the growing importance of internships and deeper collaboration between industry and academia.\\n\\nProfessor Bibhuti Bhusan Nayak, head of the career development centre at NIT Rourkela, highlighted a \\\"clear shift in both hiring strategies and industry expectations.\\\" Despite a reduction in placement percentages from 88% in 2022–23 to 70.28% in 2023–24 at NIT Rourkela, Nayak reported that the performance across key departments remained strong, attributing the dip partly to a cautious global hiring climate.\\n\\nFurther analysis shows that 22 out of 23 IITs reported a decrease in placement percentages, with IIT Dharwad experiencing the steepest drop of nearly 25 percentage points. The rise of new technologies, particularly Artificial Intelligence (AI), has influenced placement dynamics, affecting the number of companies participating in campus placements.\\n\\nA placement officer from an IIIT in South India noted, \\\"There has been a decrease in the number of companies visiting the institute for placements now compared to previous years due to changes in the market trends because of new technologies like AI. We are preparing our students to adapt to market trends to improve placements.\\\"\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"A coaching institute director confirmed that objections, along with supporting evidence, have been officially submitted.\\n\\nPhoto: Canva\\n\\nThe National Testing Agency (NTA) is once more at the centre of controversy, this time over alleged mistakes in the April 2025 JEE Main examination. Already criticised in the past for its handling of major entrance tests, the agency now faces serious questions over its credibility.\\n\\nAfter the publication of answer keys, question papers, and candidates’ recorded responses, several students—particularly from Kota, known for its coaching institutions—have highlighted errors in the examination. At least nine questions from physics, chemistry, and mathematics subjects have been challenged. These concerns have been reinforced by expert evaluations from reputed coaching institutes, further calling into question the NTA’s accuracy and transparency.\\n\\nAmong the disputed questions, four are from physics, three from chemistry, and two from mathematics. According to subject experts, these are not minor discrepancies but clear factual mistakes.\\n\\nA coaching institute director confirmed that objections, along with supporting evidence, have been officially submitted. He urged the NTA to either award grace marks or exclude the problematic questions from evaluation. One example flagged by a physics faculty member involves a question on hydrogen-like ions. The answer given by NTA is based on an atomic number of 2, while the correct value should be 3. Another disputed item in the current electricity section shows an answer of 125mA instead of the correct value, which is 5mA. A separate question on equivalent resistance reportedly did not contain any valid answer among the options given.\\n\\nStudents, along with coaching centres, are now awaiting the NTA’s formal response to the raised objections.\\n\\nHowever, the incident has further damaged public trust in the agency. With the JEE Main playing a pivotal role in university admissions—and with each mark carrying significant weight—pressure is increasing on the NTA to not only address these specific errors but also to undertake a wider reform of its examination processes.\",\n",

      "        \"title\": \"Why personalised 1-on-1 coaching outperforms traditional business education\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"In a rapidly evolving business world, personalised coaching provides real-time, emotionally intelligent support that bridges the gap between knowledge and action—giving entrepreneurs the clarity, confidence, and edge to lead effectively.\\n\\nPhoto: Canva image\\n\\nIn a world where industries take overnight turns and decisions need to be made in real time, business leaders are more frequently looking for support beyond the traditional establishment of education. MBAs and structured programmes still have a place in this conversation; they provide foundational understanding, strategic frameworks, and access to useful networks or opportunities. However, they do not always attend to the urgency, uniqueness, and emotional complexity that an entrepreneur experiences in real time.\\n\\nThis is where personalised 1-on-1 coaching fits in—not as a replacement for, or a shortage of, valuable education, but as the edge many entrepreneurs now recognise as necessary. Once thought of as a value-add or last-resort addition, coaching has become a pragmatic strategic investment made by founders who want to grow and evolve in their role with clarity, speed, and confidence.\\n\\nA different kind of growth tool\\n\\nEntrepreneurs today face considerably more than predictable strategy. They must continuously have the capacity to adapt in real time, lead through uncertainty, and make decisions with imperfect information. In many cases, an educational background in business is not designed for such fluidity.\\n\\nCoaching is inherently directed at the present, tailored to the founder’s specific context, industry, leadership style, and objectives. Whether the aim is to scale faster, expand the business footprint, or make an outright directional shift, 1-on-1 coaching will focus the entrepreneur on achieving the outcome they are pursuing.\\n\\nNot a service for the stuck, but fuel for the fast movers\\n\\nThere can be a false sense that coaching is only for people who are struggling or in pain. In our day and age, that is far from the truth. More and more high-performing entrepreneurs are looking for coaches not because they are failing, but because they want to grow differently.\\n\\nFor some, it is about speed—providing acceleration for growth. For others, it is about width—offering a greater vision. And for many, it is about depth—aligning business goals and objectives with their personal hopes and dreams or being intentional about the culture they are building. You see, today's coach is not just a sounding board. A coach is often a strategic thought partner to help bring perspective, structure, and accountability.\\n\\nThe power of a non-judgemental fellow traveller\\n\\nBeing an entrepreneur can be an overwhelming experience. Even in rooms filled with other employees, partners, or investors, a founder may struggle to be candid about their doubts, fears, or possible decisions. It is often difficult to find a place to sort through all these thoughts without judgement or fear of ramifications.\\n\\nThis is where a coach is uniquely positioned—somebody who is outside of the company but passionately committed to the founder's success. A fellow traveller who can share in the highs and lows while providing clarity without an agenda. With a coach, an entrepreneur can think out loud, challenge themselves, or reset when necessary—all while being free of the pressure to perform.\\n\\nFrom learning to action\\n\\nA regular dysfunction in conventional learning environments is the time lag between learning and doing. Knowledge is important, but it is action that drives results. The value of coaching for clients is in creating a bridge from conversation to plan, and from plan to action and outcomes—with effective accountability built into the process.\\n\\nAdditionally, coaching evolves adaptively throughout the year. Strategies are revisited, priorities recalibrated, and wins celebrated—not just quarterly, but weekly. This regular rhythm of applied learning creates not only effective coaching, but sustainable coaching.\\n\\nThe future is personalised\\n\\nThe issue isn’t whether an MBA or advanced education is worthwhile—it generally is. But the world of entrepreneurship is changing, and what leaders need now is customised, real-time, emotionally intelligent support. Coaching provides that advantage. In today’s world, 1-on-1 coaching is not a sign of weakness. It’s an indication of purposeful leadership. For a professional entrepreneur acting in a complicated environment, it’s no longer a luxury, but a tactic.\\n\\n(The author is a Business & Leadership Coach)\",\n",

      "        \"title\": \"Evaluating the shift from degree-based hiring to skill-based recruitment in tech\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"India’s tech sector is shifting from degree-based hiring to a skills-first approach, driven by digital transformation and evolving industry demands\\n\\nImage by Canva\\n\\nIndia’s tech sector is undergoing a quiet but decisive shift. Companies that once prioritised academic qualifications from top institutions are now rethinking how they identify talent. Skills—particularly those that match real-time business needs—are taking centre stage. Whether it is in AI, cybersecurity, or green tech, recruiters are leaning toward a more agile, outcomes-based approach to talent acquisition.\\n\\nThis change is rooted both in trend and necessity. According to Mercer | Mettl, only 45 per cent of recent graduates have the skills employers seek. The lag between education and industry expectations is increasing, as companies rush to implement next-gen technologies without the workforce to support them.\\n\\nThe World Economic Forum projects that by 2025, 97 million new roles will emerge globally, powered by AI, robotics, and IoT.\\n\\nRahul Veerwal, CEO and co-founder of GetWork, explains how this shift is unfolding in real time, “At GetWork, we have witnessed how AI is rapidly driving the shift toward skill-based hiring by empowering companies to assess candidates on real-world capabilities rather than just academic credentials. Technology is uncovering hidden talent in Tier 2 and 3 cities—individuals who may lack elite degrees but have the skills to excel. This evolution is making the hiring process more inclusive, efficient, and aligned with the demands of the modern workforce.”\\n\\nA LinkedIn report, India Future of Recruiting 2023, found that 75 per cent of recruiters now believe skills-first hiring is the next step. For technology roles, employers are targeting proficiencies in data science, machine learning, blockchain, and cloud infrastructure—areas that often require hands-on exposure rather than just theory.\\n\\nKorn Ferry’s research reinforces this shift, indicating that organisations hiring based on skills are 57 per cent more likely to adapt to changes and meet evolving challenges effectively. These organisations are hiring talent that can transition across roles, collaborate across disciplines, and think beyond traditional job descriptions.\\n\\nReflecting on this transition from the skilling side, JPS Kohli, Founder & Group CEO, SkillUp noted, “At SkillUp, we believe the future of hiring belongs to those who can do, not just those who know. The industry is moving beyond traditional degrees towards skills that speak for themselves. Today’s employers need talent that is ready to deliver from day one, with real-world experience and problem-solving ability. That is why our learning approach is deeply learner-centric — focused on outcomes, flexibility, and partnerships with global tech leaders.”\\n\\nThis whole shift is tied closely to how fast digital transformation is happening. AI, for example, is being picked up across industries, with sectors like BFSI and tech moving fastest.\\n\\nMeanwhile, hiring patterns across sectors are also reflecting the move to specialized skillsets. IT firms are scouting for talent in programming and AI integration; Fintech wants blockchain engineers and cybersecurity professionals, while investment banks are on the lookout for data analysts and algorithm specialists. In each case, the capability to solve problems and innovate in real-time outweighs the need for academic laurels.\\n\\nThis has prompted education and skilling platforms to rethink how they structure their offerings. Industry-led certifications, boot camps, and apprenticeship programs are now becoming viable alternatives to full-time degrees. Some platforms are designing learning experiences around real-world scenarios, often teaming up with industry players to make it as practical as possible.\\n\\nThe push toward this model is also helping address regional talent disparities. As Rahul Veerwal of GetWork points out, AI-powered recruitment tools are enabling employers to tap into previously overlooked talent pools in smaller cities. This is making the tech hiring process not only more accurate but also more democratic.\\n\\nRecruitment models are also evolving to support this change. Tech-driven assessments, scenario-based evaluations, and AI-enabled screening tools are replacing conventional resumes and interviews. Companies are increasingly offering “trial projects” or gig-based evaluations before making full-time offers—giving candidates the opportunity to demonstrate their skills directly.\\n\\nWhat’s unfolding is a redefinition of merit. For today’s tech employers, it is not about where a candidate studied—it is about what they can contribute from the start. For candidates’ skills are the ticket to long-term career relevance.\\n\\n\",\n",

      "        \"title\": \"Equity over inclusion: The role of mentorship and returnship for women in tech\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"Mentorship and returnship programmes are transforming the workplace into a space where everyone can thrive.\\n\\nImage by canva\\n\\nTalent is spread across a diverse spectrum, and to thrive in the competitive market, organisations today need to be well-prepared to embrace & harness this diversity to deliver more together. While the Indian technology sector has experienced a positive increase in the number of women in the field, the representation of women in decision-making, innovation, and research-based roles is still limited. These gaps call for a shift beyond Diversity and Inclusion.\\n\\nTrue progress needs ''Equity,'' ensuring that women have the resources, opportunities, and systemic support they need to grow at every stage of their careers. It's recognising the unique challenges women face and providing the resources, opportunities, and support needed to thrive rather than expecting them to navigate barriers on their own. In the end, we need a diverse range of perspectives that lead to more balanced and sustainable decisions.\\n\\nEmployers investing in growth opportunities for women unlock great potential, driving innovation and strengthening their workforce.\\n\\nInitiatives such as mentorship, returnships, leadership development programmes, upkilling and reskilling, employee resource groups, women's leadership groups, or even an in-house creche can create pathways for career advancement. By implementing initiatives like the above, companies can empower women leaders and build a more inclusive and dynamic workplace.\\n\\nThe power of mentorship\\n\\nEffective mentorship goes beyond traditional learning - it inspires, connects, and drives lasting change. When organisations cultivate a strong culture of mentorship, they enable an environment where everyone feels supported, grows together, and makes a meaningful impact.\\n\\nMentorship can come in many forms. From senior mentorship, peer-to-peer guidance, or reverse mentorship, all these relationships enable continuous learning in the workplace and ensure that everyone progresses together.\\n\\nMany companies like Hexagon R&D India have recognised the power of mentorship. They are integrating it into their culture through structured programs. Our Programs like MentHer connect women with mentors for guidance and networking, while the Gengage program facilitates reverse mentorship between Gen-Z employees and senior leaders and the WILL Program connects women with a supportive peer network for collaboration.\\n\\nA well-structured mentorship program is crucial for women navigating male-dominated tech world. It's not just about guidance, it’s about empowerment. Investing in it not only strengthens the leadership pipeline but also drives innovation and a forward-thinking organisation.\\n\\nThink of a workplace where women have access to experienced mentors who support their aspirations and offer insights, encouragement, and direction. It’s a space where they can openly share experiences and challenges with senior professionals, learning from their journeys. This kind of network accelerates personal and professional development and continuous learning.\\n\\nAlso, it is great for everyone involved. Having mentored two women leaders every quarter, for many years, I've seen firsthand how mentorship is mutually rewarding. Additionally, the impact extends beyond individual relationships, creating an environment with free-flowing knowledge and multiplying opportunities.\\n\\nEffective mentorship should go beyond traditional learning and aim to inspire, connect, and create lasting change. A workplace that prioritises mentorship is not just nurturing talent, it is shaping the leaders of tomorrow.\\n\\nNew pathway forward with returnship programmes\\n\\nCareer breaks are common, and they could be for various reasons like motherhood, caregiving, mental health, or just a break. Yet, these breaks are often viewed as taboo, with organisations still hesitant to hire women who have taken a break. What we tend to overlook is that returning candidates often come back stronger and more well-rounded, with renewed energy and broader perspectives. As technology evolves rapidly, adapting to new skills and tools should not be a challenge for them.\\n\\nReturnship programmes provide a valuable opportunity to help diverse candidates transition back into the workforce, bringing fresh insights, energy, and experiences. Embracing this talent pool drives inclusivity and taps into an underutilised resource of capable professionals eager to contribute.\\n\\nOrganisations, including Hexagon R&D India, are proactively supporting professionals returning to the workforce. One such initiative is the Begin.Again program, designed to help women transition back after a career break. Through highly paid internships and a guaranteed full-time offer upon successful completion, the programme provides an inclusive and supportive pathway to re-enter the workforce.\\n\\nAt Hexagon R&D India, we have a no-questions policy, meaning we do not enquire about the reasons behind a woman's career break. Through this approach, we ensure that returning candidates are not judged on their gaps solely on their capabilities and potential.\\n\\nThe success of Begin Again has been remarkable, with candidates who have taken breaks of up to 14 years achieving conversion rates of over 90 per cent into full-time roles. Additionally, these returning colleagues show higher levels of engagement and often become champions of workplace inclusivity, further enriching the organisational culture.\\n\\nWhen organisations invest in meaningful reintegration, they unlock untapped potential and strengthen their workforce in the future.\\n\\nA call to action\\n\\nEquity is a mindset that drives change. We need to create workplaces where everyone can lead, innovate and thrive. Companies that take action will not only drive diversity but also a stronger more dynamic industry for the future.\\n\\nThe author is the Senior Vice President and Head, Hexagon R&D India.\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"Since returning to office, President Trump has intensified pressure on educational institutions to eliminate diversity policies and confront antisemitism.\\n\\nPhoto: Wikimedia Commons\\n\\nHarvard University has become the first major American institution to openly resist demands from the Trump administration to alter its policies. The proposed changes, described by critics as sweeping and intrusive, would have significantly reshaped the university’s operations and handed greater control to the federal government.\\n\\nPresident Trump had accused several leading universities of failing to safeguard Jewish students, particularly during widespread campus demonstrations in 2024 that condemned the war in Gaza and US support for Israel.\\n\\nIn a message addressed to the Harvard community on Monday, President Alan Garber revealed that the White House had delivered an “updated and expanded list of demands” on Friday, together with a warning that continued federal funding was contingent on the university’s compliance.\\n\\n“We have informed the administration, via our legal representatives, that we will not accept their proposed agreement,” Garber wrote. “Harvard will not forfeit its autonomy or abandon its constitutional protections.”\\n\\nHe emphasised that the institution took its responsibility to counter antisemitism seriously, but described the federal government’s demands as excessive.\\n\\n“While some of the proposed measures are aimed at tackling antisemitism, the bulk of them constitute direct interference with the intellectual framework of the university,” he added.\\n\\nShortly after Garber’s statement was issued, the US Department of Education announced it was halting $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in active contracts awarded to Harvard.\\n\\n“Disruption to learning on university campuses in recent years is unacceptable,” the department declared. “Harassment of Jewish students cannot be tolerated. Elite universities must demonstrate they are willing to enact real change if they wish to continue receiving taxpayer funds.”\\n\\nIn a separate letter issued on Friday, the White House accused Harvard of having “failed in recent years to uphold the intellectual and civil rights standards that justify federal investment”.\\n\\nThe letter outlined ten areas where reforms were demanded, including requirements for departments to display “viewpoint diversity”, the appointment of a government-approved external auditor to investigate academic units linked to alleged antisemitic behaviour, and the reporting of students viewed as “hostile to American values” to federal authorities.\\n\\nFurther stipulations included the imposition of disciplinary measures for student protests over the past two years and the abolition of the university’s diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.\\n\\nSince returning to office, President Trump has intensified pressure on educational institutions to eliminate diversity policies and confront antisemitism.\\n\\nIn December 2023, university leaders were called before Congress in a tense hearing, where they were strongly criticised for perceived failures to protect Jewish students following the outbreak of conflict between Israel and Hamas two months earlier.\\n\\nClaudine Gay, then Harvard’s president, faced backlash after suggesting in her testimony that whether calls for violence against Jews breached the university’s code of conduct would depend on context. She later apologised, but the incident, coupled with plagiarism allegations, led to her resignation in January.\\n\\nIn March, the Trump administration disclosed it was reviewing approximately $256 million in federal contracts and grants awarded to Harvard, along with a further $8.7 billion in long-term funding commitments.\\n\\nIn response, a group of Harvard academics launched legal proceedings, accusing the administration of breaching academic freedom and free speech rights.\\n\\nPreviously, the government had also withdrawn $400 million in federal support from Columbia University, citing its alleged failure to address antisemitism and protect Jewish students.\\n\\nAt the time, Secretary of Education Linda McMahon stated, “Universities must abide by all federal anti-discrimination laws if they wish to receive government funding.”\",\n",

      "        \"title\": \"AI for the Win: How PwDs are benefiting from AI Tools\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"AI is breaking digital barriers and redefining accessibility, empowering persons with disabilities to thrive and lead in an inclusive digital world.\\n\\nImage from canva\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is at the forefront of global innovation, driving advancements across various sectors. According to PwC projections, AI is expected to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Industries have transformed through AI to deliver better results and improved user experiences. AI's impact on accessibility solutions is no exception. It has made significant strides in enhancing accessibility and improving the user experience, especially for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs).\\n\\nWhile organisations and society have made progress in physical accessibility, digital accessibility still lags behind. Efforts have been made, but much more is needed. In this age, digital platforms are now the most popular and convenient way to consume information, and barriers to digital accessibility hinder the growth of PwDs. Limited access to digital resources poses significant challenges for PwDs, affecting their ability to access essential services such as education, employment, and information. According to the WHO, nearly 1.3 billion people worldwide, or 16% of the global population, experience some form of disability. For this large population, digital accessibility is not a luxury but a necessity.\\n\\nAI as an enabler for accessibility\\n\\nAI-powered accessibility solutions play a crucial role in creating an inclusive environment for individuals with disabilities. These solutions enhance navigation, usability, and communication, catering to diverse needs. By leveling the playing field, AI empowers PwDs to pursue growth and development opportunities.\\n\\nHere are some ways AI-powered solutions enable accessibility and foster inclusivity:\\n\\nTransformative AI Technologies for Accessibility\\n\\na) AI and assistive technologies\\n\\nAI has transformed the landscape of assistive technologies, presenting significant advancements for PwDs. Amid these advancements, text-to-speech cloning technology stands out as a game-changer. By leveraging AI to study and mimic an individual's distinct vocal traits, it enables people who have lost their ability to speak to express themselves using a voice that closely mirrors their own. This is not only a technological marvel but a reflection of how AI can serve humanity by replicating and enhancing fundamental human abilities.\\n\\nb) Predictive AI and communication\\n\\nAI enhances communication for PwD individuals through its predictive text capabilities. With word suggestions or even entire phrases, AI reduces the time and effort required for users to convey their thoughts. This not only accelerates interactions but also reduces the cognitive burden, streamlining the entire communication process. For people who may struggle with traditional input methods, AI's intuitive prediction mechanisms can anticipate their needs and facilitate a smoother exchange of ideas. This aspect of AI is a crucial development in making digital communication more accessible.\\n\\nc) Automated testing and scanning\\n\\nAutomated AI scanners play an essential role in detecting accessibility issues on websites. By performing extensive tests aligned with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), these tools streamline compliance efforts and improve usability, promoting a more inclusive digital experience.\\n\\nEnhancing digital experiences with AI\\n\\na) Improved virtual assistance\\n\\nAI-powered virtual assistants such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant have become tools of utmost importance for the PwD individuals. These AI assistants offer personalised solutions, adapting to the preferences and needs of various user groups. Right from controlling smart home devices to setting up alarm clocks, these virtual assistants make lives easier for PwDs.\\n\\nb)Better audio and video captioning\\n\\nAI excels in generating real-time captions for audio and video content. Automated transcription tools and advanced lip-reading capabilities provide crucial support for individuals with hearing impairments, ensuring they can access and engage with multimedia content.\\n\\nc) Image recognition and alt-text generation\\n\\nAI-powered image recognition technology automatically generates alt-text for images, enabling visually impaired users to understand visual content. This capability bridges accessibility gaps by offering real-time descriptions, making digital content more inclusive and informative.\\n\\nAI is poised to revolutionise accessibility for PwDs, unlocking new possibilities for a fully inclusive workforce. By seamlessly eliminating digital barriers, AI will enable organisations to create dynamic, forward-thinking workplaces where PwDs can thrive with equal opportunities for growth alongside their peers. With advanced tools, personalised training, and adaptive technologies, companies will empower PwDs to deliver groundbreaking results. Embracing digital accessibility is not just a progressive step; it is an essential part of shaping the future of work in a truly inclusive world.\\n\\nThe author is the Executive Vice President – Global Corporate Communications, CSR, DEI and ESG, HGS\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"edForce is transforming workforce development by aligning training with business goals, and adapting upskilling to meet sector-specific demands.\\n\\nImage from canva\\n\\nBusinesses are constantly searching for methods to upskill their employees and keep up with technical breakthroughs in the quickly changing employment market of today.

By acting as an extended L&D arm, the platform helps organisations build a sustainable learning culture that drives long-term growth.\\n\\nExpanding horizons: Beyond IT\\n\\nWhile edForce has established a strong presence in the IT sector, the company is now expanding into non-IT industries such as banking, healthcare, and retail. By doing so, it is widening its course offerings to address emerging needs in these sectors. For example:\\n\\nBanking & Finance – Training in fintech, blockchain, and risk management.\\n\\nHealthcare – Upskilling in healthcare analytics, digital health solutions, and AI-driven diagnostics.\\n\\nRetail & E-commerce – Courses in supply chain analytics, customer data management, and AI-driven personalisation.\\n\\nPartnership with industry leaders\\n\\nA crucial factor that enables edForce to deliver top-tier upskilling solutions is its collaboration with leading global enterprises. By forging strong partnerships with industry giants such as Infosys, Walmart, Siemens, Microsoft, Dell, and Amazon, edForce designs and delivers training programs that directly align with the specific skill needs of these organisations. These partnerships not only reinforce edForce’s credibility as a premier upskilling provider but also ensure that learners receive industry-approved training that meets the highest global standards.\\n\\nFuture roadmap\\n\\nWith a remarkable YOY growth of over 500% and a recovering revenue of Rs 25 Cr. for FY 24-25, edForce is set to expand globally. The company is investing in technological infrastructure, AI-driven learning platforms, and strategic partnerships to enhance its training offerings further. As the demand for upskilling and reskilling continues to grow, edForce remains committed to delivering cutting-edge training solutions that empower businesses and professionals alike.\\n\\nedForce’s ability to deliver industry-specific, customised upskilling programs has positioned it as a leader in workforce development. By focusing on targeted skill enhancement, end-to-end training management, and real-world application, the company is effectively bridging the skills gap across multiple sectors. As edForce continues to innovate and expand, it is well on its way to redefining the future of professional learning and development in India and beyond.\\n\\nThe author is the CEO & Co-Founder of edForce.\",\n",

      "        \"title\": \"How affordable online MBA programs are transforming business education\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"The pursuit of an MBA program has long been a hallmark of career progression for business professionals. However, the costs of the traditional MBA route—including hefty tuition fees, relocation costs, and the opportunity cost of a career pause—have often deterred many from taking the plunge. The rise of online MBA programs has changed the landscape, offering a more flexible and cost-effective alternative without compromising quality or professional commitments.\\n\\nThe growing popularity of online MBA programs\\n\\nAs India aims to enroll 92 million students in higher education institutions by 2035, scalable and accessible learning solutions have become increasingly essential. Online MBA programs offer business professionals an opportunity to upskill without pausing their careers. With regulatory support reinforcing their credibility, these programs are now widely accepted. Over 500 UGC-approved online degree programs are currently offered by nearly 95 universities across India. Furthermore, the UGC has declared online degrees equivalent to traditional on-campus degrees in terms of academic rigor and professional recognition, making them a trusted option among employers. Unlike traditional programs that involve high campus maintenance and administrative costs, online\\n\\nMBA programs leverage digital platforms to reduce expenses. India’s digital expansion—marked by 1.2 billion smartphone users and an estimated 900 million internet users by the end of 2025—has further driven the accessibility and affordability of these programs.\\n\\nWhat makes an online MBA affordable?\\n\\nAn online MBA program’s trademark feature is affordability. Traditional institutions incur heavy costs for campus upkeep, staff housing, and administration expenses. However, online programs use digital platforms to provide qualitative education at much lower expenses, which becomes applicable to many students seeking financial assistance. The increased digital ecosystem available in India drastically improves affordability. With over a billion smartphone users, online education is simpler than ever. Since professionals from varying socioeconomic classes are now able to afford internet services, pursuing an online\\n\\nMBA without relocation or commuting is far from being a distant reality. The flexible structure of an online MBA further contributes to its affordability. With open-term dates, online MBA programs frequently use the modular method. Students have the flexibility to enroll in micro-courses, earn stackable credentials, and progress through courses at their own speed. Many institutions adopt a competency-based learning approach where practical, employable skills are taught without excessive and unnecessary coursework, allowing the students to maximize their educational value.\\n\\nIn addition, strategic collaboration with industry giants has also increased the credibility of programs offered online. As corporations have come to recognize the value of investing in their employees' reskilling by paying in advance, these partnerships assist many companies in establishing subsidized tuition. Employers are increasingly funding employee education through affordable tuition fees or sponsoring MBAs, which eases the cost burden on students while meeting industry demands.\\n\\nTo minimize financial barriers, many online MBA programs provide flexible payment schedules, scholarships, and deferred payment plans through income-share agreements. These programs allow new workers to finish a course and start a job without financial strain, as payments can be made in installments after getting hired.\\n\\nHow to evaluate an affordable online MBA?\\n\\nWhen looking for an affordable online MBA program, it is important to understand that low price does not mean low quality. Accreditation is a critical factor as bodies like AMBA, AACSB, or EQUIS also offer global credibility for a high level of recognition. Moreover, well-accredited MBAs ensure that the graduates remain competitive beyond the local job market.\\n\\nReturn on Investment (ROI) is a factor equally important to accreditation. There is no doubt that an MBA program from a reputable institution would offer positive career outcomes like salary increases, fast-tracked career growth, and employment at top-tier corporations. It is crucial that prospective students consider alumni success stories to determine the employability benefits and overall ROI of the program.\\n\\nAnother crucial factor to consider when evaluating an online MBA program is its approach to learning. Quality programs that integrate innovative and non-conventional teaching strategies like case-study methods, simulations, AI personalized learning approaches, and several others, guarantee a vastly superior educational experience and skill outcome.\\n\\nAdditionally, accessibility is also greatly affected by the flexibility of the learning model. Most asynchronous online MBA programs allow students to attend classes at any time, complete assignments at their own pace, and get instructions in person or remotely, which makes it easier for full-time professionals to meet their academic goals without halting their professional growth or compromising personal commitments.\\n\\nNetworking opportunities are another key factor that distinguishes a good online MBA program. While physical campuses, by their nature, help in networking, an online program should offer digital networking opportunities, alumni engagement, mentorship programs, and other avenues for similar industry engagement. These features allow students to expand industry connections and professional reach through a virtual format.\\n\\nUnlike elite business schools that charge premium tuition fees, affordable online MBA programs have unique advantages. These institutions' ability to rapidly adopt new technologies, as well as shifts in business practices, makes them a proactive alternative to more traditional institutions. In addition, these programs appeal to students from many different professional and cultural backgrounds, which enhances collaboration.\\n\\nFinal thoughts\\n\\nThere's no doubt that the online MBA landscape is shifting, and business education is evolving to include skill-based learning and corporate training. With growing emphasis on AI integration, immersive learning experiences, micro-MBA, and specialized executive programs, online MBA programs hold a significant edge over on-site, traditional alternatives. Consequently, we expect the demand for affordable, high-quality online MBA programs to continue to rise. With government policies supporting higher education expansion and technological advancements making digital learning more immersive, the online MBA market is set to grow significantly, with the projected size of India’s online higher education market expected to reach Rs 85,000 crores by FY 2028, growing at a CAGR of 23.1%.\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"A single-page declassified CIA document has gone viral for its bizarre claim detailing a clash between Soviet soldiers and aliens - an encounter that allegedly ended with 23 Russian troops being turned to stone.\\n\\nThe incident reportedly took place during the Cold War era, around 1989 or 1990, during a military training exercise in Siberia. It came to light after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, when the KGB was dissolved. A 250-page report compiled by the KGB - later acquired by the CIA - recounted the extraordinary events that unfolded after a Soviet military unit allegedly spotted a UFO.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThe document includes numerous photographs, drawings, and eyewitness testimonies from participants in the event. A CIA representative described the case as \\\"a horrific picture of revenge on the part of extraterrestrial creatures, a picture that makes one's blood freeze.\\\"\\n\\nThe report claims, \\\"A quite low-flying spaceship in the shape of a saucer appeared above a military unit that was conducting routine training manoeuvres. For unknown reasons, somebody unexpectedly launched a surface-to-air missile and hit the UFO. It fell to earth not far away, and five short humanoids with large heads and large black eyes emerged from it.\\\"\\n\\nTwo soldiers, who remained alive after freeing themselves from the debris, testified, \\\"The aliens came close together and then merged into a single object that acquired a spherical shape. That object began to buzz and hiss sharply, and then became brilliant white. In a few seconds, the spheres grew much bigger and exploded by flaring up with an extremely bright light.\\\"\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n\\\"At that very instant, 23 soldiers who had watched the phenomenon turned into... stone poles,\\\" recalled the soldiers who survived as they stood in the shade and were less exposed to the luminous explosion.\\n\\nThe KGB report claimed that the 'petrified soldiers' and remains of the UFO were transported to a secret scientific research facility near Moscow. Soviet specialists allegedly concluded that an 'unknown energy source had instantaneously altered the soldiers' biological structure, transforming them into a substance with the same molecular composition as limestone'.\\n\\nThe CIA concluded the report by saying, \\\"If the KGB file corresponds to reality, this is an extremely menacing case. The aliens possess such weapons and technology that go beyond all our assumptions. They can stand up for themselves if attacked.\\\"\\n\\nThe CIA document was declassified in 2000 and was originally covered by Weekly World News in Canada and the Ukrainian newspaper Holos Ukrayiny. The story resurfaced in 2024 when it was featured on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast.\",\n",

In an interview with India Today, he said law enforcement coordination had improved and that both countries were in regular contact over extradition requests, including that of David Coleman Headley, convicted in connection with the 2008 Mumbai attacks.\\n\\nGarcetti also addressed trade issues, noting tensions over tariffs and the need for a bilateral agreement. He said that the two countries must manage differences through direct talks. Garcetti pointed to the importance of shared interests in reducing dependence on China and called for steady engagement to strengthen the Indo-Pacific partnership.\\n\\nMeanwhile, China’s leader, Xi Jinping, responded to the latest tariff hike in the trade dispute with the United States. “We are not afraid,” Xi said in his first public comment on the matter, after Beijing raised tariffs on US goods to 125 percent.\\n\\nThe move followed a US decision under former President Donald Trump to raise tariffs on Chinese goods to 145 percent. China has said it does not plan further increases, calling further escalation ineffective. Watch the full episode to know more.\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"India is expected to receive above-normal monsoon rainfall in 2025, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasting seasonal rainfall at 105% of the long-period average. The projection comes with a model error margin of 5%, officials announced on Tuesday.\\n\\nThe southwest monsoon typically begins its advance over Kerala around June 1 and withdraws by mid-September. The projected above-average rainfall could provide a much-needed lift to the agricultural sector, the Ministry of Earth Sciences said.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nAccording to the IMD, this year’s forecast suggests that most parts of the country are likely to benefit from favourable rainfall conditions, with the exception of a few regions. Rainfall is expected to be below normal in Ladakh, the Northeast, and Tamil Nadu during the four-month monsoon season.\\n\\nThe IMD defines normal rainfall as between 96% and 104% of the 50-year average of 87 cm (about 35 inches). Any amount above this range is considered “above normal.”\\n\\nThe officials said all key climate factors — including the El Nino and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) — are currently in a neutral phase. These neutral conditions are considered favourable for a healthy monsoon.\\n\\nEl Nino refers to a climate pattern where the surface waters of the central and eastern Pacific Ocean become warmer than usual, often leading to weaker monsoons and less rainfall in India. The Indian Ocean Dipole refers to a weather phenomenon in the Indian Ocean where the difference in sea surface temperatures between the western and eastern parts affects rainfall. A positive IOD usually brings more rain to India, while a negative IOD can reduce it.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nApart from these, another positive indicator this year is the reduced snow cover over Eurasia and the Himalayan region. Historically, lower snow cover in these areas has been associated with stronger monsoon rainfall in India.\\n\\nWith favourable ocean and atmospheric conditions in place, this year’s monsoon is expected to be above-average and provide much-needed relief to the agricultural sector.\\n\\nPublished By: sharangee Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"A Congress MLA in Tamil Nadu, Hasan Maulana, assured residents that no one would be evicted from a Vellore village where a dargah had issued eviction notices after claiming the land as Waqf property.\\n\\nHowever, he added that villagers would be required to pay a nominal rent if the Waqf Board’s claim to the land is substantiated by supporting documents. “Once a Waqf, always a Waqf,” Maulana said.\\n\\nHis remarks came after about 150 families in Kattukollai village, in Vellore district, reportedly received notices stating that their land belongs to the Waqf.\\n\\nThe notices were issued by a person named F Syed Satham, who claimed that the land in Kattukollai belongs to a local dargah. India Today accessed a notice sent by Satham to a man named Balaji, accusing him of encroaching on Waqf land registered under survey number 362. According to the notice, Balaji had constructed a house and a shop on the property, which, as per Waqf records, belongs to the mosque.\\n\\nThe notice stated that residents must seek permission, pay ground rent, and comply with Waqf laws—or face legal eviction.\\n\\nSyed Sadam, who became caretaker of the dargah and mosque following his father's death in 2021, claims the land has belonged to the Waqf Board since 1954 and says they have documents to prove it.\\n\\nAccording to Sadam, his late father lacked formal education and awareness and therefore did not collect rent from those living on the land. Now, Sadam says he intends to rectify this by collecting rent from the residents.\\n\\nHe stated that two more notices will be sent, and if there is no response, the matter will be taken to the High Court.\\n\\nThe residents, however, say they have lived on the land for four generations and consider it their own. They are upset that Sadam is now demanding rent, whereas his father never did.\\n\\nThe issue gained attention when concerned villagers gathered at the District Collector’s office fearing eviction. Praveen Kumar, Divisional Secretary of the Hindu Munnani, said all 150 families had received similar notices, despite having government-issued documents and paying panchayat taxes. He urged the Collector to grant official land titles (patta) to the villagers, who are anxious about losing their homes and livelihoods.\\n\\nAccording to the residents, the Vellore District Collector has informally advised them not to pay rent for now.\\n\\nThis is the second such Tamil Nadu village that has been claimed by the Waqf law. Previously, a Tiruchendurai village was also sent similar notices saying the land belonged to Waqf board.\\n\\nPublished By: Preeja Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"In a recent podcast with Zerodha's Nikhil Kamath, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates shared his vision of a future where artificial intelligence (AI) replaces both blue and white-collar jobs within the next two decades.\\n\\nHe believes this shift will alleviate labour shortages and significantly change how we approach work and leisure.\\n\\nAI TO REPLACE HUMAN LABOUR ACROSS ALL PROFESSIONS\\n\\nGates predicts that advancements in AI will reduce the global reliance on human labour across various professions.\\n\\nHe stated, “Let’s say 20 years from now, AI will have changed things enough that just this pure capitalistic framework probably won’t explain much because AI both sort of white-collar type work and, as blue-collar workers, the robots will get some good hands and are able to do the physical things the humans do.”\\n\\nDuring the conversation, Gates remarked that when AI develops with \\\"awfully good\\\" hands that can do so many of the jobs that humans do, the world will no longer face shortages in professions such as doctors, teachers, or factory workers.\\n\\n“Those shortages won’t exist. And so it’s a pretty profound change that will free up a lot of time,” he said.\\n\\nSHIFT TOWARDS SHORTER WORK WEEKS AND REDEFINED TIME USE\\n\\nGates envisions a future where people can retire early and enjoy shorter work weeks. He suggests this will require a philosophical rethink about how time should be spent, as AI will handle tasks like food production, manufacturing, and medical diagnostics.\\n\\n“You can retire early, shorter work weeks, and it’s going to require almost a philosophical rethink about, ‘okay, how should time be spent?’” he noted.\\n\\nCONVERSATION WITH NIKHIL KAMATH COVERS VARIOUS TOPICS\\n\\nThe wide-ranging interview also touched on discussions about tech leaders like Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Steve Jobs, Gates’ memoir Source Code, his visits to India, and more.\\n\\nBill Gates' predictions about AI replacing both blue and white-collar jobs within the next 20 years suggest a transformative shift in the workforce.\\n\\nThis change could lead to reduced labour shortages and a reimagined approach to work-life balance.

      "        \"text\": \"The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has said that visas and immigration statuses for nine of its international students and researchers were revoked without any prior warning or explanation. The move comes as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration as well as an attempt to temper the activism that they perceive as hostile to conservatives.\\n\\nTill now, the US government has cancelled the visas of nearly 530 students, faculty and researchers across 88 colleges and universities, as per a report by CBS.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nIn a letter to the MIT community, university president Sally Kornbluth on Monday expressed concern over the recent government actions that, she said, threatened not just MIT's operations but also the country's ability to attract top global talent and maintain scientific leadership.\\n\\n\\\"Since April 4, nine members of our community - students, recent graduates and postdocs - have had their visas and immigration status unexpectedly revoked,\\\" Kornbluth wrote, adding that the lack of any official communication or rationale from the government was alarming.\\n\\nWhile the institute was not directly involved in the lawsuit filed by one affected student, it says it remained \\\"extremely concerned\\\" about the broader implications.\\n\\n\\\"These actions are interfering with the normal functioning of MIT,\\\" Kornbluth said. \\\"They diminish our ability both to serve the nation and to attract the world's finest talent.\\\"\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThe visa revocations come alongside a separate federal policy shift that prompted MIT and several other top-tier universities, including Princeton, Caltech and the University of Illinois, to sue the Department of Energy (DOE) in a Boston federal court.\\n\\nThe lawsuit challenges the administration's sudden decision to cap indirect research cost reimbursements at 15 per cent, a move that could result in hundreds of millions in lost funding for academic institutions engaged in high-stakes research.\\n\\nIndirect costs cover vital infrastructure and services that support scientific research but aren't tied to a specific project. These include safety protocols, facility maintenance, data storage and compliance systems. MIT noted that nearly 1,000 members of its community rely on DOE grants, which were now at risk.\\n\\nIn her letter, Kornbluth said the cuts would \\\"devastate scientific research at America’s universities\\\" and hurt the country's long-term innovation prospects.\\n\\n\\\"To find those rare people (with exceptional talent), we open ourselves to talent from every corner of the US and from around the globe,\\\" she wrote. \\\"The threat of unexpected visa revocations will make it less likely that top talent from around the world will come to the US - and that will damage American competitiveness and scientific leadership for years to come.\\\"\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThe Department of Energy announced the new cap on April 11, saying it would make federal research spending more transparent and efficient. But universities say the change is unfair and disruptive, especially since many had already agreed on much higher reimbursement rates. For example, the University of Michigan could lose over USD 30 million because of this new rule.\\n\\nThis is the second time in recent months that universities have been forced into court over similar actions. Earlier this year, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) imposed a similar funding cap, which was then challenged in court. A federal judge issued a permanent injunction halting those cuts while the case proceeds.\\n\\nThe government is using funds to negotiate with the universities and ensure they comply with the directives. The punishment for defiance is freezing of funding, like with Harvard University.\\n\\nThe Trump administration on Monday froze approximately USD 2.3 billion in federal funding to Harvard University after the Ivy League school refused to comply with a list of White House demands to limit activism on campus and dismantle its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes.\\n\\nThe freeze includes USD 2.2 billion in grants and USD 60 million in federal contracts, according to the department's task force on combating antisemitism, which said Harvard's resistance reflected \\\"the troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation's most prestigious universities\\\".\\n\\n(With inputs from Reuters)\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"After days of turmoil triggered by US President Donald Trump’s tariff strikes, Dalal Street seems to have found its feet again. Indian equities roared back to life on Tuesday, with both the Sensex and Nifty surging over 2%, effectively wiping out all losses incurred since the shock announcement on April 2.\\n\\nTrading resumed after a long weekend, but there was no slowdown in terms of momentum. The Nifty50 climbed as much as 2.4% intraday, comfortably reclaiming its pre-tariff territory, while the Sensex gained over 1,600 points.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nBroader markets mirrored the optimism, with small-cap and mid-cap indices also posting solid gains. Both the main market indices are set to close the trading session on a strong note.\\n\\nWHAT TODAY’S MARKET RALLY MEANS FOR INVESTORS\\n\\nTuesday’s bounce wasn’t just a technical recovery. It was laced with a growing narrative that India, for all its vulnerabilities, is increasingly being viewed as a safe harbour in turbulent global waters.\\n\\n\\\"Indian equities are relatively better positioned right now,” said Gary Dugan, CEO of The Global CIO Office. “There’s good domestic growth, the market isn’t as exposed to export shocks, and we are seeing interest shift toward India as a structural China-plus-one play.\\\"\\n\\nThe contrast with China is hard to miss. While Beijing has dug in for a retaliatory fight in response to Washington’s fresh wave of tariffs, New Delhi has kept its tone diplomatic, quietly working behind the scenes toward a provisional deal.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThat conciliatory stance is paying dividends, at least in the eyes of foreign investors who are beginning to see India as a more stable node in the fractured global supply chain.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the US president’s latest hint at pausing future tariffs gave the markets exactly the breather they were waiting for. Volatility, which spiked alarmingly in early April, cooled off dramatically, lending further confidence to risk-takers.\\n\\nToday's rally was broad-based and across sectors. Heavyweights such as Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, SBI and Bharti Airtel all surged. Key sectors, including autos, banks, real estate, metals and financials, led from the front.a\\n\\nSTART OF A FRESH BULL RUN?\\n\\nStill, not everyone is rushing to call this the start of a new bull run.\\n\\n“The S&P 500 is up 9% from its April lows. Nifty has barely risen 3%. We’re still playing catch-up,” said Dr VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services. “The short-covering we’re seeing could fuel further gains, but the uncertainty around Trump’s trade moves hasn’t vanished. Sectoral tariffs are likely next, and that could hurt pharmaceuticals in particular.”\\n\\nHis advice is to stay with stocks rooted in domestic demand. Financials, telecom, hospitality, aviation and healthcare are sectors with earnings visibility and relatively low global exposure.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nMarket watchers agree that the India VIX may have cooled, but it's still hovering 46% above its pre-selloff levels. “Risk appetite remains fragile,” said Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit. “Unless volatility drops meaningfully, pushing past 23,000 on the Nifty may prove difficult. A breakout to 23,400 or even 24,000 needs a big global trigger and calm nerves.”\\n\\nFor now, the message from the Street is clear. The Dalal Street rally has legs, but it’s jogging on a tightrope. Investors would do well to resist the urge to chase momentum blindly. Be selective, not aggressive. Stick with quality. The bulls may be back, but so are the risks.\\n\\nPublished By: Koustav Das Published On: Apr 15, 2025\\n\\nTune In\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"After Harvard University rejected the Trump administration's demands to limit campus activism, former US President Barack Obama praised the university for setting an example for other higher education institutions.\\n\\nOn Friday, US President Donald Trump wrote to Harvard demanding the university audit views on diversity on campus and stop recognising certain student clubs. In response, University President Alan Garber wrote in a letter to the Harvard community on Monday, \\\"No government-regardless of which party is in power-should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.\\\"\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nCommending Harvard for defying what he described as the government's \\\"ham-handed\\\" attempt to stifle academic freedom, Obama posted on X, \\\"Harvard has set an example for other higher-ed institutions - rejecting an unlawful and ham-handed attempt to stifle academic freedom, while taking concrete steps to make sure all students at Harvard can benefit from an environment of intellectual inquiry, rigorous debate and mutual respect. Let's hope other institutions follow suit.\\\"\\n\\nJust hours after Harvard's rejection of the demands - which called for broad institutional reforms, changes to admissions policies, or risk losing $9 billion in grants and contracts - the US government announced it would freeze more than $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts to the university.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nColumbia University was the first to be targeted by the Trump administration, ultimately agreeing to the demands under the threat of massive funding cuts. The administration has also paused federal funding for the University of Pennsylvania, Brown, Princeton, Cornell, and Northwestern.\\n\\nTrump's administration has increasingly used the extraordinary tactic of withholding federal funds to pressure academic institutions to align with its political agenda and influence campus policies. The administration has argued that universities allowed antisemitism to go unchecked during last year's campus protests against Israel's war in Gaza.\\n\\nGarber stated that Harvard has already enacted extensive reforms to address antisemitism. He argued that many of the government's demands are unrelated to antisemitism and instead aim to regulate the \\\"intellectual conditions\\\" at the university.\\n\\nGarber said that withholding federal funding from Harvard, one of the nation's top research universities in science and medicine, risks not only the health and well-being of millions of individuals but also the economic security and vitality of our nation. He also claimed the action violates the university's First Amendment rights and exceeds the government's authority under Title VI, which prohibits discrimination based on race, colour, or national origin.\\n\\nAmong the government's demands were requirements that Harvard implement \\\"merit-based\\\" admissions and hiring policies, conduct an audit of students, faculty, and leadership on their views about diversity, and ban face masks on campus-an apparent move against pro-Palestinian protesters. The administration also called for a ban on face masks at Harvard - an apparent target of pro-Palestinian campus protesters - and pressured the university to stop recognising or funding \\\"any student group or club that endorses or promotes criminal activity, illegal violence, or illegal harassment.\\\"\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nIn response, the federal antisemitism task force said Monday that Harvard's defiance \\\"reinforces the troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation's most prestigious universities and colleges-that federal investment does not come with the responsibility to uphold civil rights laws.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The disruption of learning that has plagued campuses in recent years is unacceptable. The harassment of Jewish students is intolerable.\\\"\\n\\nTrump has promised a more aggressive approach to combatting antisemitism on campus, accusing President Joe Biden of being too lenient. His administration has launched new investigations, and in some cases, detained and deported foreign students involved in pro-Palestinian protests.\\n\\nThe Trump administration's actions prompted a group of Harvard alumni to write to university leadership, urging them to \\\"legally contest and refuse to comply with unlawful demands that threaten academic freedom and university self-governance.\\\"\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n\\\"Harvard stood up today for the integrity, values, and freedoms that serve as the foundation of higher education,\\\" said Anurima Bhargava, one of the alumni behind the letter. \\\"Harvard reminded the world that learning, innovation and transformative growth will not yield to bullying and authoritarian whims.\\\"\\n\\nThe government's pressure on Harvard also sparked a protest over the weekend from the campus community and residents of Cambridge and a lawsuit from the American Association of University Professors on Friday challenging the cuts.\\n\\nIn the lawsuit, plaintiffs argue that the Trump administration failed to follow the procedures required under Title VI before initiating cuts, including the obligation to notify both the university and Congress.\\n\\n\\\"These sweeping yet indeterminate demands are not remedies targeting the causes of any determination of noncompliance with federal law,\\\" the plaintiffs wrote. \\\"Instead, they overtly seek to impose political views and policy preferences advanced by the Trump administration, and to commit the university to punishing disfavoured speech.\\\"\\n\\n(With inputs from AP)\\n\\nPublished By: Anupriya Thakur Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"text\": \"Even as Chennai Super Kings fans dream of a comeback from the five-time champions following a rocky start to their IPL 2025 campaign, some worrying visuals have emerged of MS Dhoni limping after his heroics against the Lucknow Super Giants. The CSK captain did not appear to be at his physical best on Monday, April 14, despite delivering an all-round performance that helped end the team's five-match losing streak.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nDhoni showed signs of discomfort even while keeping wickets. After pulling off a magical run-out of Abdul Samad, he was visibly struggling to maintain his balance. Nevertheless, he walked out to bat when Super Kings required more than 10 runs per over in the final five overs of the chase. He went on to smash 26 off just 11 deliveries in a match-winning partnership with Shivam Dube. Dhoni relied heavily on big shots, avoiding quick singles and steering clear of pushing for extra runs between the wickets.\\n\\nLater, he was later seen limping as he descended the stairs of the dressing room for post-match duties. In fact, Dhoni appeared unable to walk freely as he made his way to collect the Player of the Match award - his first such honour in the IPL in seven years.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nIn a more concerning video that has since gone viral on social media, Dhoni was spotted limping again while entering the team hotel in Lucknow on Monday. However, he was not wearing a knee brace or cap when stepping off the team bus.\\n\\nThala Dhoni limping , Hopefully not a serious one pic.twitter.com/cYfPOpWARG— Chakri Dhoni (@ChakriDhonii) April 15, 2025\\n\\nWhile it is no secret that Dhoni has been managing a troublesome knee over the past few years, Monday marked the first time this season that he was seen in visible discomfort.\\n\\nHowever, neither MS Dhoni nor the Chennai Super Kings management have expressed any concerns over a potential injury. CSK’s bowling coach, Eric Simons, did not address the matter when speaking to the press following the team’s victory in Lucknow.\\n\\nDhoni remained calm and composed on the field after winning the toss and choosing to field against a power-packed Lucknow Super Giants batting line-up. He was sharp behind the stumps and executed a sensational run-out with a direct hit from well behind the wicket, catching the batter short at the non-striker's end. He was also tested by Matheesha Pathirana, who sent down several deliveries straying down the leg side, keeping Dhoni on his toes.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThanks to Dhoni's excellent glovework and a disciplined bowling performance, Super Kings restricted the Super Giants to 166 runs in their allotted 20 overs.\\n\\nDhoni has been managing a wobbly knee throughout his recent IPL stints. During the 2023 season, he led CSK to their fifth IPL title while playing through pain, before undergoing surgery in Mumbai after the tournament.\\n\\nHowever, knee concerns resurfaced in 2024. Despite the recurring issues, Dhoni managed to play all 14 matches for CSK last season.\\n\\nIn a recent podcast, Dhoni said that his future in the IPL would depend on how his body responds at the end of each season.\\n\\nCSK fans will be hoping the veteran wicketkeeper recovers in time and regains full fitness ahead of their high-stakes clash against the Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede Stadium on Sunday, 20 April. The Super Kings have a five-day break before that marquee fixture.\\n\\nPublished By: Akshay Ramesh Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

India play a 5-match series against England in the months of June, July, and August. That series finishes on August 4. However, as seen in recent times, there has been more and more segregation between the teams in all formats of the game.

      "        \"text\": \"Just days after the NEET UG controversy, the National Testing Agency (NTA) is once again facing sharp criticism -- this time over factual mistakes and technical issues in the JEE Main 2025 Session 2 exam.\\n\\nStudents, parents, and educators are up in arms after the release of the provisional answer key and response sheets on April 11.\\n\\nCOACHING HUB KOTA FLAGS MULTIPLE ERRORS\\n\\nThe latest storm was kicked off by students from Kota, Rajasthan -- India’s biggest coaching hub for engineering aspirants, as per a Times of India report. These students spotted at least nine questionable answers in the JEE Main 2025 April 9 paper.\\n\\nThe errors span all three core subjects: four in physics, three in chemistry, and two in maths. Students say the problems aren’t just tricky questions -- they are factually incorrect and could seriously affect scores.\\n\\nTop coaching centres and subject experts backed the students’ claims, saying the problems show poor quality control by NTA for such a major national exam.\\n\\nEducator and commentator @kamath_pramod posted on X, “It’s unacceptable that such basic mistakes are creeping into national-level exams.” He highlighted one modern physics question from the April 7 AM shift, calling it “conceptually flawed.”\\n\\nHe added, “If NTA doesn’t correct this, it’s an injustice to lakhs of students.”\\n\\nAnother user on X put it bluntly: “Tragedy of errors – JEE Main response sheet is different from what students actually filled in many cases + lot of answers wrongly given by NTA.”\\n\\nRESPONSE SHEET MESS ADDS TO STUDENTS’ WORRIES\\n\\nThe issue goes beyond just the answer key. Several candidates and their parents reported major errors in the response sheets shared by NTA. Some students said their selected answers were wrongly recorded, while others found the sheets showing blank responses.\\n\\nPramod Kamath, who is also a parent, posted on social media, “Indeed my daughter attempted 71 questions. During submission it showed 71 questions attempted & now in the response sheet it is showing all questions as unanswered! Shocking! NTA is playing with the future of children. No response on email!”\\n\\nAnother student, who appeared for the April 3 shift 2 exam, said he had selected the first option for a physics question, but the response sheet now shows the second option.\\n\\nOne parent, Rekha Verma, wrote on X, “My daughter has attempted 50 questions but it is showing 48. So many questions showing the wrong attempt. We will mail to NTA for this blunder. I am very worried for her.”\\n\\nA different user added, “Actually we are also experiencing similar issue on answer sheet shared by NTA. We request to the management to review and publish error free results.”\\n\\nA mother whose daughter regularly scored between 180-190 in practice tests said her child’s answer sheet now shows several incorrect options that were not marked by her.\\n\\n'BLANK' ANSWERS AND UNRESPONSIVE NTA\\n\\nSome students even reported that the system simply didn’t record their answers at all. One X user shared, “Answers submitted were not considered and shows up as ‘blank’. An email to NTA went unanswered. Ridiculous that they conduct an exam for such premier institutes and are least bothered about the transparency. Who will guard the guards?”\\n\\nIn another post, someone said the same issue occurred with his sister’s paper -- one question was missing her chosen answer entirely.\\n\\nOPPOSITION LEADERS JOIN IN, QUESTION NTA’S CREDIBILITY\\n\\nAs reports of errors spread, political leaders also stepped in, questioning the NTA’s ability to conduct high-stakes exams.\\n\\nReferring to the TOI report, Congress leader Supriya Shrinate posted in Hindi on X:\\n\\n“The NTA is already facing questions over the conduct of competitive exams – last year's CUET-UG, NEET-UG answer sheets also had errors. Is the NTA capable of conducting these exams? Was the tension of unemployment and paper leaks not enough for our youth that now they have to deal with a weak NTA as well?”\\n\\nWHAT NEXT FOR STUDENTS?\\n\\nThe window to challenge the JEE Main 2025 Session 2 answer key has already closed, and the results are expected by April 17. But with so many discrepancies raised -- from factual errors to technical glitches -- students are demanding that the NTA drop the flawed questions or award bonus marks.\\n\\nSo far, there’s been no official response from the agency. With lakhs of students depending on this exam to secure a place in top engineering colleges, the silence is only fuelling anxiety.\\n\\nAll eyes are now on the NTA -- will it admit to the issues and act, or leave students to bear the consequences?\\n\\nPublished By: Roshni Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

      "        \"title\": \"Like Adolescence, Indian films and shows that mastered one-shot technique\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"There's something about one-shot scenes that brings an inherent excitement, and a sense of unparalleled immersiveness to cinema. A section of the audience couldn't have been more aware of this camera technique until Netflix's 'Adolescence' broke the barriers of storytelling. It was raw, well-coordinated, demanding and so precise that it provided an extra edge to the story. But, this is not the first time that the Indian audience and filmmakers have woken up to this kind of camera movement technique.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nSeveral OTT shows and films have done the same over the years in various scenes to give the audience a taste of something different, something that sets them apart. Have a look at a few here:\\n\\n1. Ship of Theseus (2012): The mother is admitted scene (7 minutes)\\n\\nSohum Shah’s 'Ship of Theseus' wasn’t just a philosophical piece, it was also technically brilliant. One of its most powerful scenes, where a mother is admitted to the hospital, plays out in a 7-minute continuous take. The shot captures the chaotic yet intimate emotions of a man navigating bureaucracy, morality, and grief — all in one breathless sequence that never cuts away.\\n\\n2. Viduthalai (2023): The train scene (8 minutes)\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nVetri Maaran’s 'Vidhuthalai' delivers an edge-of-the-seat 8-minute sequence involving a train and a tense, escalating situation. Shot in a single take, the scene is a technical surprise, immersing the audience right into the unfolding drama with no moment to pause or look away. The fluid camera work and the unflinching performances make it one of the most gripping one-take sequences in Indian cinema.\\n\\n3. The Family Man (2019): Hospital assault sequence (13 minutes)\\n\\nShot in a real, functioning hospital with actual heart patients in the ward, this 13-minute one-take sequence is one of 'The Family Man's' most intense moments. Filmed from the villains' perspective, it builds a wave of dread as danger creeps toward unsuspecting characters.\\n\\nInterestingly, despite having just two nights at the expensive location — one for rehearsal, and another for shooting - co-director DK refused to break the shot. And the team pulled it off in a single go. It can definitely be seen as a masterclass in coordination, tension, and bold storytelling.\\n\\n4. Gangs of Wasseypur (2012): Home shootout (7 minutes)\\n\\nAnurag Kashyap’s 'Gangs of Wasseypur' is known for its gritty realism, and one of its standout moments is a seven-minute one-take sequence capturing a frantic shootout. The camera doesn't flinch and follows Faizal Khan's (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) character running through narrow alleys, ducking bullets, and raging through the violence. It's tense, raw, with a slight punch of humour making it deeply cinematic — a moment that stays with you long after the film ends.\\n\\n5. Dil Dhadakne Do (2015): The Gallan Goodiyan song (4 minutes)\\n\\nNot all one-take scenes are about action or intensity. Sometimes, it’s about capturing joy. The 'Gallan Goodiyan' song from 'Dil Dhadakne Do' is a vibrant 4-minute single-shot celebration, following the characters around a cruise ship dinner party as they sing and dance. It’s also something which can be seen as choreography-triumph, with a spontaneous and infectious sense of pure joy.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n6. CID - The Inheritance (111 minutes)\\n\\nOn November 7, 2004, Sony TV ran a special episode of CID, titled 'The Inheritance', without any single cut. BP Singh, the director of the show, wanted to make an entry into the Guinness Book of World Records and Limca Book of Records, and therefore, he decided to shoot a 111-minute-long episode of the popular show using the one-shot technique, which later went into the pages of history. It didn't just create a record for the longest shot episode, but also for the longest shot to be filmed ever.\\n\\nThe one-shot sequences are demanding. They demand perfection, a solid hold on one's craft, and the best kind of coordination between artistes, cinematographers, directors and the audience. At the end of it all lies audacity, and a spirit to experiment. Indian cinema and the OTT space got to stay on the hustle.\\n\\nPublished By: Vineeta Kumar Published On: Apr 15, 2025\",\n",

Victory is virtually assured for the PAP, which has led Singapore since its independence in 1965.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\n\\\"We are witnessing profound changes in the world. It is becoming more uncertain, unsettled and even unstable,\\\" Wong wrote on Facebook. \\\"The global conditions that enabled Singapore’s success over the past decades may no longer hold. That is why I have called this General Election,\\\" adding that Singaporeans should choose \\\"the team to lead our nation\\\".\\n\\nWong, who was sworn in as Singapore’s fourth leader in May last year, wants to clinch a stronger win after the PAP suffered a setback in 2020 polls over voters’ rising discontent with the government.\\n\\nHe succeeded Lee Hsien Loong, who stepped down after two decades at the helm. Lee’s departure marked the end of a family dynasty started by his father, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore’s first leader, who built the former colonial trading outpost into one of the world’s richest nations during 31 years in office.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nIn the 2020 polls held during the COVID-19 pandemic, the PAP maintained its supermajority with 83 out of 93 seats.

The PAP’s share of popular support also slipped to a near-record low of 61 per cent.\\n\\nAs Wong heads into his first general election as PAP chief, he has sought to reach out to disgruntled younger voters. He launched a \\\"Forward Singapore\\\" plan that aims to give Singaporeans a say in how to develop a more balanced, vibrant and inclusive agenda for the next generation.\\n\\nThe PAP will field more than 30 new candidates to refresh the party. Wong has warned that \\\"who you have in the cockpit matters\\\" amid economic uncertainties as US tariffs hit the global trading system.\\n\\n\\\"The biggest contest we face isn’t between political parties, it’s Singapore vs the world,\\\" Wong said in a Facebook post earlier this week. \\\"Our mission ... is clear: to keep our nation a shining beacon of stability, progress and hope\\\".\\n\\nWhile Singapore has flourished as one of the world’s wealthiest nations, it has also become one of the most expensive cities to live in. The PAP has been criticized for tight government control and a government-knows-best stance, media censorship and the use of oppressive laws against dissidents.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nIssues like widening income disparity, increasingly unaffordable housing, overcrowding caused by immigration and restrictions on free speech have also loosened the PAP’s grip on power.\",\n",

      "        \"title\": \"Union Minister says new Waqf Act will not let Munambam-like issue to happen\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"Union minister Kiren Rijiju defended the recent amendments to the Waqf Act, arguing the changes were necessary to prevent arbitrary land grabs and address long-standing grievances.\\n\\nSpeaking in Kerala on Tuesday, Union Minister Kiren Rijiju said the move was vital to protecting people’s rights over their land. “Land is the most precious thing. Many countries go to war for it. We must protect every inch for its rightful owner,” he said.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nRijiju criticised the past provisions of the Act for giving “unprecedented powers” to Waqf boards, which he alleged had been misused in several cases—including the Munambam land dispute in Kerala.\\n\\nThe Munambam case, where the Kerala Waqf Board declared 404 acres as Waqf property, allegedly depriving over 600 fishermen of ownership, was a focal point of his address. Rijiju called it a “tragedy” and promised justice. “The government will ensure such cases do not happen again,” he said.\\n\\nHe said that as part of the reforms, the Centre has struck down Section 40 of the Act, which had empowered Waqf Boards to unilaterally declare any land as Waqf. “No authority should have uncontrolled power. All future surveys will be led by the District Collector and based strictly on government records,” Rijiju said.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nHe flagged the scale of unchecked claims, stating that over 18 lakh properties were declared as Waqf between 2013 and 2025. “If we don’t act now, people will continue losing ownership. Once declared Waqf, it’s irreversible—that cannot continue,” he said.\\n\\nThe amended law now makes a registered Waqf deed mandatory for any claim. It also bars the declaration of disputed or sub-judice land as Waqf. Another major change is the removal of the “Waqf by user” clause, which allowed claims without documentation. “That was dangerous,” Rijiju said.\\n\\nThe Minister also announced that all state Waqf boards and tribunals will be reconstituted. Explaining the legal premise, he said, “If a Waqif dedicates a property, then it becomes Waqf—but it cannot be transferred. That’s the core of the Munambam issue. It can be challenged.”\\n\\nTaking aim at the Congress, Rijiju said the 2013 amendments made by the party allowed sweeping Waqf claims. “We’ve now brought in strict safeguards,” he said. The new law also allows appeals against Waqf Tribunal decisions in High Courts and restructures board and tribunal composition.\\n\\nRijiju said he would visit Munambam later that evening to meet affected residents. Referring to a case involving Mohammad Siddiqui Sait, he said, “Once land is transferred, it is no longer Waqf. The High Court ruling can be challenged in the Supreme Court.”\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nHe urged the Kerala government to act swiftly. “We’re in a federal setup. We’ve made the law, now the state must implement it. The Centre will provide all legal and administrative support to help people reclaim their land.”\\n\\nAddressing concerns that the amendments target Muslims, Rijiju said, “There’s a false campaign claiming we’re anti-Muslim. In fact, crores of poor Muslims have also been denied Waqf benefits. The majority get nothing. This law is not against any community.”\\n\\nHe also flagged other alleged overreaches. “In some instances, Waqf Boards have unilaterally declared entire villages and even Parliament as Waqf property. One person even claimed a third of Delhi. These kinds of unlimited claims will no longer be allowed. Our position is very clear.”\\n\\nPublished By: Afreen Published On: Apr 15, 2025\\n\\nTune In\",\n",

      "        \"title\": \"Bat sizes under scanner: Why BCCI introduced in-match checks in IPL 2025\",\n",
      "        \"text\": \"Before the 2025 IPL season, had you ever seen umpires checking the size of bats out in the middle? Probably not. In a first, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has instructed on-field umpires to carry out regular bat size checks during matches in this season of the premier T20 league.\\n\\nThe practice of assessing bat sizes isn't new. Previously, players would submit their bats for inspection either before a match or on its eve-usually inside the dressing room. Those checks were conducted away from public view.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nIn a bid to step up vigilance, on-field umpires have now been directed to use the 'home-shaped bat gauge' during the game itself. According to The Indian Express, every batter must pass the gauge test before taking guard.\\n\\nDuring the first two weeks of April, several batters-including Hardik Pandya, Phil Salt, and Shimron Hetmyer -- had their bats checked by the umpires on the field. To the BCCI's satisfaction, none of the bats examined exceeded the dimensions outlined in the IPL's official rule book. The regulations specify that the bat's width must not exceed 4.25 inches, and it must pass freely through the gauge.\\n\\n\\\"The blade of the bat must not exceed the following dimensions: Width: 4.25 in / 10.8 cm, Depth: 2.64 in / 6.7 cm, Edge: 1.56 in / 4.0 cm. Moreover, it must be able to pass through a bat gauge,\\\" the rule states.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nWhat prompted this change? Were there any violations?\\n\\n\\\"We always conducted bat checks in the dressing room before the start of the innings. Players would hand over their bats and the check would be completed there,\\\" a former umpire told news agency PTI.\\n\\n\\\"Now the question is: did any player submit one bat for inspection and use a different one on the field? If that's the case, then this new protocol is certainly justified. Players often carry multiple bats. While the weight may vary, the height, width (face of the bat), depth (middle of the blade), and edge width must remain within the ICC's prescribed limits,\\\" the umpire added.\\n\\nAccording to The Indian Express, there have been a few instances where players were found using oversized bats. Those players were let off with warnings, but the BCCI has now opted for stricter enforcement. In today's power-hitting era of T20 cricket, concerns about the bat increasingly overshadowing the ball are growing louder.\\n\\nIPL chairman Arun Dhumal, speaking to the newspaper, said the new checks aim to uphold the spirit of the game.\\n\\nTo put things in perspective, in the first three weeks of IPL 2024, teams posted 10 scores in excess of 200. That number has nearly doubled in 2025, with 19 such totals already recorded. Last season, SunRisers Hyderabad led the big-hitting charge, breaching the 260-run mark three times. They also posted the highest team total in IPL history: 287 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nThis year, SRH continued their explosive form, posting 286 in their opening game against Rajasthan Royals-just one run short of their own record.\\n\\nBOWLERS VOICE CONCERNS\\n\\nA number of bowlers, including R Ashwin, Kagiso Rabada, and Shardul Thakur, have raised concerns about the increasing imbalance between bat and ball in IPL 2025. The Impact Player rule, which allows teams to effectively play with an extra batter or bowler, has further tilted the game in favour of the batters.\\n\\n\\\"You say bowlers are becoming defensive. I want to speak about that,\\\" Ashwin said on his YouTube channel. \\\"I think bowlers will soon need personal psychologists. I genuinely mean it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let's say bowlers are becoming defensive-fine. But in several cases, bowling has genuinely become impossible,\\\" he added.\\n\\nIn a move to support bowlers, the BCCI has lifted the ban on the use of saliva to assist with reverse swing. Saliva had been prohibited by the ICC during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nAdditionally, to counter the dew factor, the BCCI has approved the use of a second ball during the second innings of IPL 2025 matches.\\n\\nPublished By: Akshay Ramesh Published On: Apr 15, 2025\\n\\nTune In\",\n",

The institute has reaffirmed its commitment to be a clean and green campus, and to promote eco-friendly behavior among campus residents. 2. A horticulture department takes initiative to plant trees and flower all over the campus and maintains it successfully throughout the year, making IIT kharagpur one of the most beautiful campuses in india. 3. The sanitation department employs many people to keep the whole campus clean, dust free of any type of waste, emphasizing on the non-biodegradable one. 4. IIT kharagpur has banned the use of plastic cups and plastic packets in the campus since 2008. Despite these bans, institute is struggling to contain the plastic waste that is generated from residences, hostels, etc. 5. IIT kharagpur promotes the use of bicycles, electric cycles, electric bikes and electric rickshaw to curb the usage of motorbikes in the campus to avoid noise as well as air pollution. IIT kharagpur has separate pathways for bicycles, walkways and motor vehicles. 6. IIT kharagpur is working towards making itself fully sustainable through solar energy to produces electricity. Presently, institute has solar panels on the rooftops of all the departments, schools and centers. Thereby its requirement of electricity supply from outside has been drastically reduced. 7. There are 10,000 students aged between 18 and 30 and approximately 20,000 people living in the campus. Residents are made aware of the pressing need for corrective action and these eco-friendly measures are the only way to preserve a large and considerably populated campus. 8. Innovation challenge grant: IIT kharagpur has initiated ‘innovation challenge grant’, a research initiative under its vision 2020 program. This grant aims at fostering and supporting innovative green technological solutions for problems ailing this campus. The research challenge is open to both undergraduate and postgraduate students. Through the innovation challenge grant, institute expects students and faculty to identify innovative technological solutions for water, energy and environment - related problems that the campus faces, within a reasonable time 9. Remarkable new initiatives are: 1. Utilizing plastic waste in road construction; 2. Using hostels’ kitchen waste for biogas generation; 3. Installing solar energy panels in hostels and departments to save energy; 4. Reducing extra water usage in hostels; 5. Cutting down the electricity usage in the library; 6. Planning a chemical waste collection system; 7. Groundwater pollution control; 8. Improving the design of garbage bins; 9. Improving the handling, utilization and disposal of electronic waste; 10. Evaluating and reducing the campus’ carbon footprint; and 11. Designing and planning a street lighting system. 12. Credit award system: the academic committee is working on devising a system where participating students can earn academic credits for their research work on eco-friendly campus. Credit award systems act like incentives to make this initiative popular among students. All students who can make their ideas to the final stage will receive project performance awards—a certificate and prize. according to the honorable director of IIT kharagpur, “the idea is to get students and faculty to work together to research ways to make the campus greener, cleaner and more energy-efficient.\",\n",
